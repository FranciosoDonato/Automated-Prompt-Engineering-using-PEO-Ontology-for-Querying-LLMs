<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the final classification.

**Text:** 'Where do you get the Sour Grapes to say this is a Bernie person?  Based on how Bernie does not allow this crap to go on where do you get off with the accusation?'

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words/phrases:** Scan the text for words or phrases that are commonly associated with toxicity, such as insults, threats, hate speech, or disrespectful language. In this text, consider phrases like ""Sour Grapes"" and ""crap.""

2.  **Assess the context:** Consider the surrounding words and phrases to understand the intent and meaning of the potentially offensive words. Is the language being used in a genuinely harmful or offensive way, or is it being used sarcastically or figuratively? ""Sour Grapes"" implies a sense of bitterness, and ""crap"" suggests disapproval. The question ""where do you get off with the accusation?"" challenges the accuser's right to make the accusation.

3.  **Determine the target:** Who is the target of the potentially toxic language? Is it directed at an individual, a group, or an idea? In this case, the target appears to be someone making an accusation, likely within a political context.

4.  **Evaluate the severity:** How severe is the toxicity? Is it a mild expression of disagreement, or does it constitute a personal attack or harassment? The tone is critical and challenging, but not overtly threatening or using slurs.

5.  **Final Classification:** Based on the previous steps, decide whether the text contains toxicity (1) or does not contain toxicity (0). Weigh the presence of potentially offensive language against the context and severity. In this case, while the language is critical and uses potentially negative terms, it doesn't reach the level of direct insults or hate speech.

"||"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, along with explanations:

**Explanation:**

*   **Label Definition:** We are classifying a given text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). Toxicity, in this context, refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to cause offense or harm.
*   **Chain of Thought:** The prompt guides the model to first analyze the text for potentially offensive, disrespectful, or harmful language. Then, based on this analysis, it should determine whether the text exhibits toxicity.

Analyze the following text for toxicity. Toxicity includes language that is rude, disrespectful, offensive, or likely to cause harm.

Text: 'The science of Star Trek always felt more ""real"" than the cowboyism of Star Wars.'

First, identify any potentially offensive or disrespectful statements in the text. Does the text contain insults, threats, or derogatory language? Is the text likely to offend or harm a particular group or individual? Consider also if the user is targeting anyone with this phrase.

Based on your analysis, determine if the text is toxic or not. If the text contains toxic elements, label it as 1. If the text does not contain toxic elements, label it as 0.

Finally, provide your answer in the following format: toxicity: \[ ]
<\prompt>
"|"The text expresses a preference for Star Trek over Star Wars, characterizing Star Trek's science as feeling more ""real"" and Star Wars as ""cowboyism.""

Potentially offensive/disrespectful statements: The term ""cowboyism"" could be seen as dismissive or condescending towards Star Wars and its themes. While not a direct insult, it simplifies and arguably belittles the franchise. It doesn't target a particular group or individual but could offend fans of Star Wars. It's a subjective statement of opinion.

The statement is not overtly toxic. It doesn't contain insults, threats, or derogatory language. It expresses a preference and uses a potentially pejorative, but not outright hateful, term. While it could offend some, it's unlikely to cause significant harm.

* **Clear Labels:** Uses the binary ""[1]"" for toxic and ""[0]"" for non-toxic, which is unambiguous.
* **Unlabeled Example:** The final example with the empty brackets `[]` correctly sets up the task for the model to predict.

**Minor Suggestions (Optional):**

* **Subtleties of Toxicity:** You could consider adding an example that's subtly toxic, perhaps sarcastic or passive-aggressive. This would test the model's ability to detect less obvious forms of negativity.  For example:

    `Text:  Oh, *that's* a really interesting idea.  I'm sure it will work perfectly.
    Answer: toxicity: [1]`

* **Edge Cases:** You could include an example that's borderline, where it's debatable whether it's toxic or just critical. This can help the model learn the nuances of toxicity. For example:

    `Text: Your analysis is interesting, but I think it misses some key points.
    Answer: toxicity: [0]` (Assuming the feedback is delivered respectfully)  OR  `[1]` if delivered harshly.

**Final Version (Incorporating optional suggestions):**

```

"|"Okay, I can create a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying text as toxic or not.

<prompt>
First, read the provided text carefully. Then, identify any language that could be considered offensive, hateful, discriminatory, or disrespectful. Consider the context of the text and whether the language is used to target individuals or groups based on their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristics. Also, consider if the text contains threats, insults, or incites violence. Finally, based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity. If the text contains any of the elements mentioned above, classify it as toxic (1). Otherwise, classify it as non-toxic (0).

Text: 'The science of Star Trek always felt more ""real"" than the cowboyism of Star Wars.'

Therefore, does the text contain any language that could be considered offensive, hateful, discriminatory, or disrespectful? Does the text contain any threats, insults, or incite violence? Based on your analysis, the text is classified as:

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|"The text expresses a preference for Star Trek over Star Wars, using the term ""cowboyism"" to describe the latter. This is a subjective opinion and doesn't target any individual or group based on protected characteristics. It doesn't contain threats, insults, or incite violence.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion. We will break down the text and then make a final determination.

Here's the text: 'The science of Star Trek always felt more ""real"" than the cowboyism of Star Wars.'

First, identify any potentially offensive words or phrases in the text. Does the text contain insults, slurs, or pejoratives? Does the text attack any individual or group? Does the text promote violence or hatred? Is the text disrespectful or rude in any way?

Now, considering the context of the text, does the comparison between Star Trek and Star Wars introduce any toxicity? Is the statement likely to offend someone or make them feel unwelcome?

Based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity.

('Toxicity', 'Content that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion')
('Label type', 'Binary (1 if toxic, 0 if not toxic)')
('Language', 'English')

Therefore, the final answer should be: toxicity: []
(Fill the square brackets with 1 if the text contains toxicity, and 0 if it does not).
<\prompt>
"|0.0|"Let's analyze the text: ""The science of Star Trek always felt more ""real"" than the cowboyism of Star Wars.""

* **Potentially offensive words/phrases:** The phrase ""cowboyism"" could be perceived negatively by some Star Wars fans, implying a lack of sophistication or a simplistic approach. However, it's not inherently offensive. It's a descriptive term that carries a mild negative connotation in this context. There are no insults, slurs, pejoratives, or attacks on individuals/groups. The text does not promote violence or hatred.

* **Context and potential for offense:** The text is a comparison of two popular science fiction franchises. Such comparisons are common and often lead to debate, but are not necessarily toxic. While a Star Wars fan might disagree and feel their favorite franchise is being slightly belittled, the statement is presented as a subjective feeling (""felt more 'real'""). It's an opinion, not a factual assertion of inferiority, and the language is relatively mild. The use of quotation marks around ""real"" suggests the author acknowledges the subjective nature of the statement.

* **Toxicity determination:** The text expresses a preference and uses a potentially negative, but ultimately descriptive, term to contrast the two franchises. While some Star Wars fans might disagree or even be slightly annoyed, it's unlikely to make someone feel unwelcome or leave a discussion. The level of disrespect is low, and the statement is presented as a personal opinion.

Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to determine if the text contains offensive, harmful, or inappropriate language.

**Text:** 'Nincompoop, that's a nice one! I'm partial to silly goose.'

Here's our thought process:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words/phrases:**  Scan the text for words that could be considered insults, slurs, or generally offensive. In this case, the word ""Nincompoop"" might be potentially offensive.
2.  **Assess the context:**  Determine how the potentially offensive words are being used. Is it used in a playful way, or is it truly intended to harm or offend? The phrase ""silly goose"" is often used playfully.
3.  **Consider the overall tone:** Determine the overall tone of the text. Is the tone aggressive, sarcastic, or neutral? The tone here seems somewhat playful.
4.  **Determine the presence of toxicity based on ('Label definition', 'Explanation of the label'):**
    *   ('Toxicity', 'The text contains offensive language, insults, or hate speech that could be harmful or offensive to others.')
5.  **Determine the ('Label type', 'Definition of the type of the label (e.g. binary, multiclass, ecc)'):**

6.  **Consider the ('Language', 'Language of the text'):**
    *   ('English', 'The text is written in English.')

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity includes insults, threats, hate speech, offensive language, and any content intended to demean, harass, or cause harm to an individual or group.

Here's how you should approach this task:

1.  **Read the text carefully.** Pay close attention to the words used, the context, and the overall intent.
2.  **Identify potential indicators of toxicity.** Look for insults, slurs, threats, aggressive language, or any phrases that could be considered offensive or harmful.
3.  **Evaluate the severity and intent.** Consider the degree of offensiveness and whether the language is likely to cause harm or offense. A lighthearted or joking remark should be evaluated differently than a direct and malicious attack.
4.  **Make a final determination.** Based on your analysis, decide whether the text contains toxicity.
5.  **Provide your answer in the correct format.** Your output should be in the format: 'toxicity: \[ ]'. Inside the square brackets, place '1' if the text contains toxicity and '0' if it does not.

Now, let's begin.

**Example 1:**

Text: ""You are a helpful assistant.""
The text doesn't contain any toxic language, insult or hate speech.
Therefore, toxicity is not present.
Answer: toxicity: [0]

**Example 2:**

Text: ""This is a terrible idea! You are so stupid.""
The text contain an insult.
Therefore, toxicity is present.
Answer: toxicity: [1]

**Example 3:**

Text: ""I think you are wrong, maybe we can find a solution.""
The text doesn't contain any toxic language, insult or hate speech.
Therefore, toxicity is not present.
Answer: toxicity: [0]

**Example 4:**

Text: ""Nincompoop, that's a nice one! I'm partial to silly goose.""
The text contains the word 'Nincompoop' that can be an insult.
Therefore, toxicity is present.
Answer: toxicity: [1]

"|"toxicity: [0]
"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a chain-of-thought prompt that will guide a language model to classify a given text as either toxic (1) or not toxic (0). The prompt should include an explanation of what constitutes toxicity in this context and identify the language of the text.

Here's the prompt:

<prompt>
Let's determine if the following text contains toxicity. Toxicity, in this context, refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome. Consider the presence of personal attacks, insults, threats, or language that is intended to demean or belittle the recipient. The language of the text is English.

Here is the text:

'You are incorrect.  The land is part of the Willamette Greenway Trail Program established in  1967 Oregon legislature as a public right of way and owned my the city.  The 1973 Oregon legislature passed the Willamette River Greenway Act  see the text of the law here http://www.oregon.gov/LCD/docs/goals/goal15.pdf

If you look at the map you will note the trails name is ""Willamette Greenway Trail""  this is not coincidence. 

Making repairs does in no way allow for the McCormick Pier condominium to take possession of public land. If you bothered to do any research you would have hit upon this fact.'

First, carefully analyze the text for any instances of toxic language as defined above. Identify any specific phrases or sentences that could be considered rude, disrespectful, threatening, or insulting.

Second, based on your analysis, determine whether the overall tone and content of the text warrants a classification of toxic.

Finally, provide your answer in the following format: 'toxicity: []', replacing the square brackets with '1' if the text contains toxicity, or '0' if it does not.
<\prompt>
"|"The text contains the phrase ""If you bothered to do any research you would have hit upon this fact.""

 <\prompt>
"|"This is a good start! Here's a breakdown of what's working well and some minor suggestions to improve it:

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Instruction:** The initial instruction `Classify, with 1 or 0, if the text contain toxicity or not. Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.` is concise and explicitly states the desired output format. This is crucial for getting the model to respond in a machine-parseable way.
*   **Consistent Format:** You've maintained a consistent format throughout the examples, which helps the model learn the desired structure.
*   **Variety of Examples:** The examples cover a range of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.  Including examples that aren't overtly offensive (like the ""idiot"" example) is good because it helps the model learn the nuances of toxicity (e.g., direct insults vs. disagreement).
*   **Edge Case Example:** The last example about the Willamette Greenway Trail is a good inclusion.  It's a potentially tricky example because it uses strong language and disagreements, but it is (likely) not toxic.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Clarify Toxicity Definition (Optional):**  While the examples provide context, it might be helpful to subtly hint at the definition of ""toxicity."" You could add a parenthetical statement or a sentence that clarifies what you mean by ""toxicity,"" such as, *""...toxicity, meaning rude, disrespectful, or hateful language...""* This may not be strictly necessary given the examples, but it can help the model if you're targeting a specific type of toxicity.
*   **Consider Different Types of Toxicity:** The current examples are relatively direct forms of toxicity. To make the prompt more robust, consider including examples that demonstrate:
    *   **Sarcasm/Passive-Aggression:**  ""Oh, that's *really* helpful.""
    *   **Threats (implied or explicit):**  ""You'll regret saying that.""
    *   **Stereotyping/Prejudice:** This is a sensitive area, but including *non-offensive* examples of text that are borderline and *don't* contain toxicity can further refine the model's understanding.

**Improved Prompt (incorporating some suggestions):**

```
Classify, with 1 or 0, if the text contain toxicity or not. Toxicity includes rude, disrespectful, aggressive, or hateful language. Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwise.

toxicity: [0]
```

**Why this is important:**

*   **Robustness:** The more varied your examples, the better the model will generalize to unseen text.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** You're essentially teaching the model *your* definition of toxicity, which might differ slightly from a generic definition.
*   **Machine Parseability:** The consistent output format is critical for programmatically using the model's output.

Good job! This is a solid foundation for a toxicity classification prompt.
"|"Okay, I will generate a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying the toxicity of a given text.

<prompt>
First, carefully read the following text:

'You are incorrect. The land is part of the Willamette Greenway Trail Program established in 1967 Oregon legislature as a public right of way and owned my the city. The 1973 Oregon legislature passed the Willamette River Greenway Act see the text of the law here http://www.oregon.gov/LCD/docs/goals/goal15.pdf

Making repairs does in no way allow for the McCormick Pier condominium to take possession of public land. If you bothered to do any research you would have hit upon this fact.'

Now, let's analyze the text for potential toxicity. Consider the following aspects:

1.  **Personal Attacks/Insults:** Does the text contain any direct insults, name-calling, or attacks on the person's character?
2.  **Threats:** Are there any explicit or implicit threats of harm or violence?
3.  **Hate Speech:** Does the text promote hatred or discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.?
4.  **Offensive Language:** Does the text use profanity, obscenity, or other offensive language?
5.  **Disrespectful Tone:** Even without explicit insults, does the text employ a disrespectful, condescending, or sarcastic tone towards the reader? Does it dismiss or belittle the reader's viewpoint in an aggressive manner?

Based on your analysis, make a reasoned judgment. Does the text contain toxicity? Yes or No? Explain your reasoning.

Finally, classify the text. Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwise. Base the 1 or 0 in your analysis.
<\prompt>
"|"Here's an analysis of the text and a determination of its toxicity:

1.  **Personal Attacks/Insults:** There are no direct insults or name-calling.

2.  **Threats:** There are no threats present in the text.

3.  **Hate Speech:** There is no hate speech in the text.

4.  **Offensive Language:** There is no profanity or obscene language.

5.  **Disrespectful Tone:** The text adopts a condescending and disrespectful tone. Phrases like ""If you bothered to do any research..."" imply the reader is lazy and uninformed. The initial ""You are incorrect"" is direct but acceptable; however, the follow-up sentence is what makes it disrespectful. The tone implies the reader is incompetent or willfully ignorant.

Based on this analysis, while the text avoids explicit insults and offensive language, its condescending tone and belittling of the reader's research efforts constitute toxicity.

   - The majority of the text is factual (citations, legal references). The criticism is directed at the argument, not the person, though the phrasing edges toward rudeness.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - The text leans toward non-toxic (0) as the language is not explicitly harmful or offensive, though it is blunt and could be perceived as mildly condescending.

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The text provides factual information about the Willamette Greenway Trail Program, including references to legislation and a link to the law.
   - It corrects a perceived misunderstanding or misinformation about land ownership and usage.
   - The tone is assertive and direct, but not inherently rude or disrespectful.

2. **Potential Toxicity Indicators**:
   - Phrases like ""You are incorrect"" and ""If you bothered to do any research"" could be interpreted as dismissive or condescending, but they are not outright insults or threats.
   - The language is more focused on correcting facts rather than attacking the person.

3. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Unlike Example 1 (""You're an idiot""), this text does not use outright insults.
   - Unlike Example 4 (""Nobody cares...shut up""), this text does not include explicit disrespect or attempts to silence the other person rudely.
   - The tone is closer to Example 3 (""I disagree...but I respect""), though more assertive.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - While the text is direct and could be perceived as harsh, it does not cross the threshold into toxicity as defined (rude, disrespectful, or likely to offend with insults/threats/harmful generalizations). The focus remains on factual correction.

First, identify any potentially toxic phrases or sentences. Does the text contain any insults, threats, or offensive language? Does it express hostility towards any individual or group? Is there any language that could be interpreted as demeaning or disrespectful?

Next, assess the overall tone of the text. Is it generally respectful and civil, or is it aggressive and confrontational? Even if individual sentences are not overtly toxic, the overall tone could indicate toxicity.

Finally, based on your analysis, determine whether the text should be classified as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify the toxicity of a given text, adhering to the specified format and constraints.

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences, part of a discussion.
**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the provided text contains toxic language, such as insults, threats, or offensive statements.
**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1). 0 means non-toxic, 1 means toxic.
**Language of the text:** English

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in online discussions. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine if it contains any elements of toxicity, such as insults, threats, offensive language, or disrespectful behavior. You must carefully consider the context of the text before making your determination.

Here's how you should approach the problem:

1.  **Read the text carefully and identify potentially toxic phrases or sentences.** Pay attention to the use of strong language, personal attacks, and disrespectful tone.
2.  **Evaluate the intent behind the potentially toxic phrases.** Is the author trying to insult, threaten, or offend someone? Or are they simply expressing their opinion in a strong manner?
3.  **Consider the overall context of the text.** Is the text part of a heated debate? Is the author responding to a previous attack? The context can help you determine whether the language is truly toxic or simply part of a passionate discussion.
4.  **Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).** A text is considered toxic if it contains any elements of insults, threats, offensive language, or disrespectful behavior aimed at demeaning or harming the target. Even a single instance of such behavior warrants a '1' classification.

Now, let's consider an example.

**Example Text:** ""This is a well-written, thoughtful comment that contributes positively to the discussion.""
*   **Chain of Thought:** The text expresses a positive opinion about a comment. It uses respectful language and doesn't contain any elements of toxicity.
*   **Final Answer:** toxicity: [0]

Here's another example.

**Example Text:** ""You're completely wrong, and it's obvious you have no idea what you're talking about. Your argument is ridiculous and a waste of time.""
*   **Chain of Thought:** The text attacks the person making the argument rather than the argument itself. It uses belittling language (""no idea,"" ""ridiculous,"" ""waste of time""), which are disrespectful and potentially toxic.
*   **Final Answer:** toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text and provide your classification in the format 'toxicity: [ ]':

Text: 'You are incorrect. The land is part of the Willamette Greenway Trail Program established in 1967 Oregon legislature as a public right of way and owned my the city. The 1973 Oregon legislature passed the Willamette River Greenway Act see the text of the law here http://www.oregon.gov/LCD/docs/goals/goal15.pdf

If you look at the map you will note the trails name is ""Willamette Greenway Trail"" this is not coincidence.

Making repairs does in no way allow for the McCormick Pier condominium to take possession of public land. If you bothered to do any research you would have hit upon this fact.'
<\prompt>
"|0.0|"*   **Chain of Thought:** The text starts by stating that the previous person is incorrect and proceeds to provide factual information and legal references to support their claim. While the tone is assertive and directly challenges the previous statement, it primarily focuses on presenting evidence and correcting misinformation. The phrase ""If you bothered to do any research you would have hit upon this fact"" could be considered slightly condescending, but it doesn't reach the level of a personal attack or outright insult. The overall intent seems to be to correct misinformation rather than to demean or harm the other person.
*   **Final Answer:** toxicity: [0]

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at a final classification.

**Text:** 'So if unwanted people showed up and took over a few rooms in your house, you'd do...what now? Welcome them in?'

Here's our reasoning process:

1.  **Identify potentially toxic elements:** Examine the text for elements like insults, threats, offensive language, disparagement, or incitement to violence. Consider if the text targets any individual or group.
2.  **Assess the severity:** Evaluate the intensity of any identified toxic elements. Are they mild, moderate, or severe? Does the text express hostility, aggression, or prejudice?
3.  **Contextual Analysis:** Consider the overall context of the text. Is it part of a debate, a sarcastic comment, or a genuine expression of hate? Could the text be interpreted as satire or humor? (Note: Sarcasm can sometimes be toxic, so this needs careful judgment.)
4.  **Determine Toxicity Level:** Based on the above analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity:
    *   **Toxic:** The text contains insults, threats, offensive language, targets specific individuals or groups in a negative way, or incites violence.
    *   **Non-Toxic:** The text does not contain the above elements.

Now, let's apply this to our text: 'So if unwanted people showed up and took over a few rooms in your house, you'd do...what now? Welcome them in?'

*   The text employs rhetorical questions. The text does not contain explicit insults, threats, or offensive language. However, it is using a hypothetical scenario and a sarcastic tone to make a point. The underlying sentiment might be interpreted as unwelcoming or hostile towards 'unwanted people'.
* The text uses sarcastic remarks to emphasize a point

Based on this reasoning, does the text contain toxicity?

**Final Classification:**

Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

Here's the metadata for this task:

*   ('Label definition', 'Indicates whether the given text contains toxic content or not.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 (toxic) or 0 (non-toxic)')

"|"toxicity: [1]
"|1.0|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for classifying text toxicity, formatted as requested.

**Explanation of the Label:**

*   **Toxicity:** This label indicates whether the given text contains language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome. It includes hate speech, aggressive statements, and disparaging remarks. A text is considered toxic if it contains any of these elements.

**Language of the text:**
* English

<prompt>
First, carefully read the provided text and identify any statements that could be considered offensive, disrespectful, or aggressive. Consider whether the language used could be interpreted as hateful, threatening, or demeaning towards any individual or group. Pay attention to the context in which the words are used and whether they are intended to cause harm or distress. Break down your analysis into a series of observations about the text. After this detailed analysis, make a final determination about whether the text contains toxic content based on your observations.
Is the text is toxic? Answer 'yes' or 'no'.
Finally, classify the text based on your determination, 1 for yes and 0 for no. Answer only with toxicity: [].
Here is the text: 'After watching that video, it is lucky more people weren’t killed. Finicum was going for his gun, besides he wasn’t at all complying with Law Enforcement. In many ways it appears he was trying to distract Law Enforcement. It is sort of like watching an idiot being shot after trying avoid a major police stop with guns drawn.'.
</prompt>
"|"Here's an analysis of the provided text:

**Observations:**

*   **Minimizing Loss of Life:** The initial statement ""it is lucky more people weren’t killed"" could be seen as insensitive given that someone *was* killed. It downplays the seriousness of the situation.
*   **Justification of Violence:** The statements ""Finicum was going for his gun, besides he wasn’t at all complying with Law Enforcement"" attempts to justify the use of lethal force. While potentially factual, presenting these as justifications without further context can be perceived as biased.
*   **Dehumanizing Language:** The phrase ""watching an idiot being shot"" is highly offensive and dehumanizing. This is the most problematic part of the text. It expresses contempt for the deceased and normalizes violence against someone deemed ""an idiot.""
*   **Potential for Incitement:** While not directly inciting violence, the justification and dehumanizing language could contribute to a climate of hostility and potentially encourage further harmful actions or rhetoric.

**Final Determination:**

Yes, the text contains toxic content due to the dehumanizing language and justification of violence.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to ensure accuracy.

**Text:** 'After watching that video, it is lucky more people weren’t killed. Finicum was going for his gun, besides he wasn’t at all complying with Law Enforcement. In many ways it appears he was trying to distract Law Enforcement. It is sort of like watching an idiot being shot after trying avoid a major police stop with guns drawn.'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome. This can include insults, threats, name-calling, and offensive language.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification - either the text is toxic or it is not.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's break down the text:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive language:** Does the text contain insults, slurs, or derogatory terms?
2.  **Assess the tone:** Is the overall tone of the text respectful and neutral, or is it aggressive and hostile?
3.  **Consider the target:** Is the text directed at an individual or group in a way that could be considered offensive or threatening?
4.  **Determine intent:** Does the author appear to be intentionally trying to offend or provoke a negative reaction?

Based on this analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Explain your reasoning. Finally, provide your answer in the requested format: 'toxicity: []', with '1' if toxic and '0' if not toxic.
<\prompt>
"|1.0|"Let's analyze the text step-by-step:

1. **Identify potentially offensive language:** The text uses the term ""idiot"" to describe Finicum. This is a derogatory term.

2. **Assess the tone:** The tone is somewhat callous and unsympathetic towards the person being discussed (Finicum). While not explicitly aggressive, the casual dismissal of the shooting as ""watching an idiot being shot"" indicates a lack of respect for human life.

3. **Consider the target:** The target is an individual, Finicum, who is deceased. While he is deceased, the language used to describe him could still be considered offensive.

4. **Determine intent:** The author's intent seems to be to justify or minimize the severity of the shooting. The use of the term ""idiot"" suggests an intent to demean Finicum and his actions. While the text does not make direct threats, the dehumanizing language could be interpreted as promoting violence or justifying the use of force.

Based on this analysis, the text contains toxicity due to the use of the derogatory term ""idiot"" and the unsympathetic, almost celebratory tone surrounding a person's death.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the text contains toxic content.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (either toxic or not toxic).

**Language of the text:** English

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity can manifest as hate speech, offensive language, threats, insults, or any content that is disrespectful or harmful. We will break down the text and then provide a toxicity classification (1 for toxic, 0 for not toxic).

Text: 'After watching that video, it is lucky more people weren’t killed. Finicum was going for his gun, besides he wasn’t at all complying with Law Enforcement. In many ways it appears he was trying to distract Law Enforcement. It is sort of like watching an idiot being shot after trying avoid a major police stop with guns drawn.'

First, let's identify any potentially toxic elements in the text. The phrase ""idiot being shot"" seems potentially offensive and dehumanizing. The passage expresses a sentiment that could be interpreted as condoning violence or a lack of empathy.

Based on this analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Yes, because of the presence of dehumanizing language and potential condoning of violence.

Therefore, the classification is:

First, carefully read the provided text. Then, consider the following aspects to determine if the text contains toxicity: Does the text contain any hate speech? Does it use offensive language? Does it target any individual or group with insults, threats, or harassment? Does it promote violence or discrimination? Does it express prejudice based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristics? Finally, considering all these factors, determine whether the text, on balance, contains toxic elements. If the text contains any of these elements, even subtly, classify it as toxic. If the text is neutral, factual, or simply descriptive without expressing harmful sentiments, classify it as non-toxic.

**toxicity: [0]**"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, suitable for a large language model.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a chain-of-thought approach to break down the reasoning process.

First, let's define what we mean by ""toxicity"" in this context:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, hateful, threatening, or obscene; language that attacks or demeans a person or group based on attributes such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other identity factors.')
- ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')
- ('Language', 'English')

Now, consider the following text:

'He was driving a vehicle for the occupiers but was not connected to the original take-over of the Refuge buildings, had not been acting as a spokesperson or leader of the group, nor captured on camera committing acts of vandalism, or threats..etc. He was questioned for two hours and released but his guns and vehicle were held by police..and are being checked out... Neither was the 18 year old girl  held who was in one of the vehicles.'

Begin by analyzing the text for potentially toxic elements. Ask yourself the following questions:

1.  Does the text contain any rude or disrespectful language?
2.  Does the text contain any hateful or discriminatory language targeting individuals or groups?
3.  Does the text contain any threats or incitements to violence?
4.  Does the text contain any obscene or vulgar language?
5.  Does the text express negativity in any other way?

Based on your answers to the above questions, make a determination if the text contains toxicity. If the text does not contain toxicity, assign the label '0'. If the text contains toxicity assign the label '1'.

Finally, output your answer in the following format:
""toxicity: []""

(Remember to replace the square brackets with '1' or '0' based on your analysis.)
<\prompt>
"|0.0|"Let's analyze the text:

1.  Does the text contain any rude or disrespectful language? No. The language is factual and descriptive.

2.  Does the text contain any hateful or discriminatory language targeting individuals or groups? No. While the term ""occupiers"" might be perceived negatively depending on context, the text itself doesn't express hate or discrimination. It simply reports facts.

3.  Does the text contain any threats or incitements to violence? No.

4.  Does the text contain any obscene or vulgar language? No.

5.  Does the text express negativity in any other way? While the situation described is negative (someone being questioned by police), the *language* used to describe it is not inherently negative. It's presented in a neutral, reporting style.

Based on this analysis, the text does not contain toxicity as defined.

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity:

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences, part of a document.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the text contains any form of toxic language, including insults, threats, hate speech, or offensive statements.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1).

**Language of the text:** English

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine whether it contains toxicity. Toxicity includes insults, threats, hate speech, offensive language, and any statement intended to demean, marginalize, or harm an individual or group.

Follow these steps:

1.  Read the text carefully and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or statements.
2.  Consider the context in which these elements appear. A word or phrase that is toxic in one context may not be toxic in another.
3.  Evaluate the severity and impact of the toxic elements. Consider whether the text targets individuals or groups, promotes hatred or violence, or is likely to cause offense or harm.
4.  Based on your analysis, assign a binary label:
    *   1 if the text contains toxicity.
    *   0 if the text does not contain toxicity.

Here's an example:

Text: ""You are a useless idiot and nobody likes you.""
This text contains direct insults and is clearly intended to demean the recipient. Therefore, the correct classification is toxicity: \[1]

Text: ""The weather is nice today.""
This text contains no toxic language. Therefore, the correct classification is toxicity: \[0]

Now, analyze the following text and provide the toxicity classification in the specified format.

Text: 'He was driving a vehicle for the occupiers but was not connected to the original take-over of the Refuge buildings, had not been acting as a spokesperson or leader of the group, nor captured on camera committing acts of vandalism, or threats..etc. He was questioned for two hours and released but his guns and vehicle were held by police..and are being checked out... Neither was the 18 year old girl held who was in one of the vehicles.'.

"|0.0|"Okay, I will generate a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying text toxicity, following your instructions.

Explanation of the label:

*   **toxicity: 1** - The text contains toxic language, including hate speech, offensive terms, harassment, or any content intended to demean, insult, or promote discrimination.
*   **toxicity: 0** - The text does not contain toxic language. It is neutral, positive, or expresses opinions without resorting to harmful or offensive expressions.

Let's think step by step. We need to determine if the provided text contains any toxic elements such as insults, threats, hate speech, or offensive language. First, carefully read the text and identify any potentially harmful words, phrases, or sentiments. Consider the context in which these elements are used. If the text contains insults, slurs, or targets any individual or group with malicious intent, label it as toxic. If the text simply expresses disagreement or criticism without using offensive language, it should not be considered toxic.

Here's the text: 'Love that they also participate in the Portland Farmer's Market at PSU... and trying to gluten-shame Tastebud and propping Papa Murphy's in the same sentence is laughable.'.

Does the text contain any language that is hateful, aggressive, disrespectful, or might cause harm to an individual or group? Does the text contain personal attacks, insults, or threats? Is there any evidence of discrimination, prejudice, or malicious intent? Based on your analysis, determine if the text is toxic or not. Output your answer in the following format: toxicity: [].
<\prompt>
"|"The text expresses disagreement with someone who is ""gluten-shaming"" Tastebud and praising Papa Murphy's. While it uses the term ""laughable,"" which could be considered mildly critical, it doesn't contain any hateful, aggressive, or disrespectful language.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the provided text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to assess the presence of offensive language, insults, threats, or any content intended to harm or demean.

First, consider the definition of toxicity:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Includes threats, insults, obscenities, identity hate, and aggressive language.')

Now, consider the type of label we will use:
- ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.')

And also the language of the text:
- ('Language', 'English')

Now examine the text: 'Love that they also participate in the Portland Farmer's Market at PSU... and trying to gluten-shame Tastebud and propping Papa Murphy's in the same sentence is laughable.'

Step 1: Identify potentially offensive words or phrases. Does the text contain any words or phrases that are commonly considered offensive, vulgar, or abusive?

Step 2: Analyze the context of the words and phrases. Even if some words seem potentially offensive, are they used in a way that is clearly not intended to harm or insult?

Step 3: Determine the overall sentiment of the text. Is the text expressing a negative opinion in a way that is toxic, or is it simply expressing a disagreement or criticism in a non-offensive manner? The text criticizes someone.

Step 4: Based on your analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Answer 1 for yes, 0 for no.

Therefore, the answer is: toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Here's the breakdown of the analysis and the final answer:

*   **Step 1: Identify potentially offensive words or phrases.**

    The phrase ""gluten-shame"" could potentially be considered negative, but it depends on the context. It implies making someone feel bad for consuming gluten.

*   **Step 2: Analyze the context of the words and phrases.**

    The sentence ""trying to gluten-shame Tastebud and propping Papa Murphy's in the same sentence is laughable"" suggests the author finds it ridiculous to criticize a restaurant for offering gluten while praising a chain known for its less healthy options. The author is expressing disagreement and mockery but not directing it at a specific person with malicious intent.

*   **Step 3: Determine the overall sentiment of the text.**

    The overall sentiment is critical and mocking, but not aggressively harmful or demeaning. The author expresses disagreement with someone's viewpoint.

*   **Step 4: Based on your analysis, does the text contain toxicity?**

    Based on the definition of toxicity provided (rude, disrespectful, threats, insults, obscenities, identity hate, aggressive language likely to make someone leave a discussion), this text doesn't quite meet that threshold. It's critical and opinionated, but not overtly toxic.

Therefore, the answer is:

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity.

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates the presence or absence of toxic language in the given text. Toxic language includes hate speech, offensive language, threats, insults, and any content intended to demean, marginalize, or harm individuals or groups.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1). 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine whether it contains any form of toxicity, including but not limited to hate speech, offensive language, threats, insults, and demeaning or marginalizing statements.

Follow these steps:

1.  Read the text carefully and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments.
2.  Consider the context in which the words or phrases are used. Some words may be considered toxic in certain contexts but not in others.
3.  Evaluate the intent behind the language. Is the speaker trying to harm, demean, or marginalize someone?
4.  Determine whether the text contains any implicit or explicit biases or stereotypes.
5.  Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

Here are some examples:

*   Text: ""This is a great movie!""
    Reasoning: This sentence expresses a positive opinion and does not contain any toxic language.
    toxicity: \[0]
*   Text: ""You are stupid and ugly.""
    Reasoning: This sentence contains insults and demeaning language.
    toxicity: \[1]
*   Text: ""I hate all people from that country.""
    Reasoning: This sentence contains hate speech and expresses prejudice against a specific group of people.
    toxicity: \[1]
*   Text: ""He is so annoying.""
    Reasoning: This sentence expresses a negative opinion but does not contain overtly toxic language. Depending on context and tone, it *could* be considered mildly toxic, but generally isn't.
    toxicity: \[0]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: 'Love that they also participate in the Portland Farmer's Market at PSU... and trying to gluten-shame Tastebud and propping Papa Murphy's in the same sentence is laughable.'.

Reasoning:
toxicity: \[ ]
<\prompt>
"|0.0|"Reasoning: The text expresses an opinion about a farmer's market participant and criticizes someone for ""gluten-shaming"" a specific food vendor while praising another.

**Definition of Toxicity:** Toxicity includes any language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome. This can include insults, name-calling, threats, hate speech, and aggressive language.

**Language:** The text is in English.

**Instructions:**
Analyze the provided text and determine if it contains toxic content based on the definition above. Respond ONLY with 'toxicity: [classification]' where 'classification' is a single digit:

*   '1' if the text contains toxicity.
*   '0' if the text does not contain toxicity.

Here are a few examples:

Text: 'You are a moron and an idiot.'
toxicity: [1]

Text: 'Have a great day!'
toxicity: [0]

Text: 'I'm going to punch you in the face.'
toxicity: [1]

Text: 'Please review the document and provide your feedback.'
toxicity: [0]

Text: 'This is the worst idea ever, you are so dumb'
toxicity: [1]

Text: 'Ps I meant Rei check'
toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|"toxicity: [0]
"|0.0|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, adhering to the specified format and constraints.

**Explanation of the label:**

*   **Toxicity:** This label indicates whether the given text contains language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome. It encompasses a range of negative behaviors, including insults, threats, hate speech, and offensive language.

**Language of the text:**

*   English

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. Remember that toxicity includes rude, disrespectful, or offensive language, threats, insults, or anything that could make someone feel unwelcome. We need to carefully consider the context and potential interpretations of the text.

Text: 'Ps I meant Rei check'

First, identify any potentially offensive words or phrases. Are there any insults, threats, or derogatory terms used? Does the text target any individual or group in a negative way?

Second, consider the overall tone and intent of the message. Is it aggressive, hostile, or disrespectful? Is it likely to cause offense or harm to the recipient?

Third, based on your analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Answer 1 if it contains toxicity, 0 otherwise.

Finally, provide your answer in the format: toxicity: [].

</prompt>
"|"The text ""Ps I meant Rei check"" does not contain any explicitly offensive words or phrases. ""Ps"" is likely an abbreviation for ""P.S."" which means postscript. ""Rei check"" could refer to a name (Rei) and a request to ""check"" something.

The tone is neutral and the intent seems like a simple request. There is nothing inherently aggressive, hostile, or disrespectful about the message. It is unlikely to cause offense or harm to the recipient.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step approach to carefully evaluate the text for any language that is offensive, harmful, or disrespectful.

Here's our criteria:

1.  **Examine the text:** Read the text carefully and identify any words, phrases, or sentiments that could be considered toxic.
2.  **Consider the context:** Think about the intended meaning and potential impact of the text on others.
3.  **Assess the severity:** Determine the level of toxicity, considering factors such as the target of the toxicity, the intensity of the language, and the potential for harm.
4.  **Make a final decision:** Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

Here are the definitions we will use:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel bad or angry.')
*   ('Non-Toxicity', 'Language that does not contain any rude, disrespectful, or offensive content.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification: Toxic or Non-Toxic')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's apply this to the following text:

Text: 'Ps I meant Rei check'

First, examine the text: The text consists of ""Ps I meant Rei check"". On the surface, the phrase ""Ps I meant Rei check"" does not appear inherently toxic.

Second, consider the context: Without further context, it's difficult to ascertain the intent or potential impact of the text. ""Rei check"" could be a reference to anything.

Third, assess the severity: Due to the lack of obvious offensive language and context, the severity of toxicity is very low.

Final decision: Based on the analysis, the text does not appear to contain toxic content.

Therefore, the classification is:

toxicity: [0]
</prompt>
"||"Okay, your analysis is sound and I agree with your classification.

Here's a summary of why your reasoning is correct:

*   **Absence of Explicit Toxicity:** The text doesn't contain any profanity, insults, threats, or hate speech.
*   **Context Dependence:**  The meaning of ""Rei check"" is completely ambiguous without additional context. It could be an inside joke, a reference to a specific situation, or something completely innocuous.
*   **Low Potential for Harm:**  Without knowing what ""Rei check"" refers to, it's impossible to say that it is likely to make someone feel bad, angry, or disrespected.

Therefore, classifying it as non-toxic (0) is the most appropriate assessment.

"A brief history to provide some perspective:
McCormick Pier was the first substantial project leading to the conversion of the industrial area north of Burnside, resulting in the creation of what is now called The Pearl District. It is the root of The Pearl’s trunk.
In 1979, the Bill Naito Co. acquired the property from Union Pacific. Bill Naito was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. In 1981 he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the waterfront, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed.
The company sold the property in 2002 to a developer who successfully converted the apartments into condominiums.

Let's think step by step.

First, we need to understand what constitutes toxicity in text. Toxicity can include hate speech, threats, insults, offensive language, harassment, and any content intended to demean, marginalize, or incite violence against individuals or groups based on attributes like race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics. The key is whether the text is likely to offend, insult, threaten, or disrespect individuals or groups.

Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for classifying text toxicity:

Let's analyze the following text for toxicity:

Text: 'A brief history to provide some perspective:

Ref:

Ref:
bit.ly/23xnD3L'.

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context.
('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. It includes threats, insults, name-calling, hate speech, and excessively offensive language.')
('Label type', 'Binary: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 if the text does not contain toxicity.')
('Language', 'English')

Now, let's examine the text for any of the elements defined above. Does the text contain any insults, threats, hate speech, or offensive language? Does it target any individual or group in a disrespectful manner? Is there any language that could be considered rude or likely to make someone leave a discussion?

After careful consideration, determine if the text contains toxicity based on the definitions above.

Therefore, the classification is: toxicity: []
```

<\prompt>"||"This is a good starting point! It establishes the context, defines toxicity, and prompts the model to analyze the text based on that definition. Here are some ways we can improve it:

**1. More Explicit Instructions for Reasoning:**

*   **Break down the analysis process:** Instead of just asking ""Does the text contain any insults, threats, etc.?"", we can guide the model to identify specific phrases or sentences that could *potentially* be toxic and then explain *why* they might or might not be toxic.
*   **Focus on context:** Emphasize that toxicity is often context-dependent. A word that's generally harmless can be toxic depending on how it's used.

**2. Introduce Confidence Levels/Nuance:**

*   **Not just binary:** While the 'Label type' is binary, acknowledge that toxicity can exist on a spectrum.  Ask the model to justify its decision and rate its confidence.
*   **Consider edge cases:** Include examples of text that is borderline toxic and ask the model to explain its reasoning for classifying it one way or the other.

**3. Enhance the Definition of Toxicity (Slightly):**

*   **Add ""Identity Attacks"":**  Specifically include ""Identity Attacks"" (attacks on someone's identity, e.g., based on race, gender, religion) to the definition.  While ""hate speech"" covers some of this, being explicit helps.
*   **Include ""Aggression"":**  Add ""Aggression"" to the list of toxic behaviors, which encompasses more subtle forms of hostility than outright hate speech.

**4. Add a ""Rationale"" Section:**

*   Explicitly ask the model to provide a rationale for its classification. This is crucial for understanding *why* the model made its decision and for debugging any potential biases.

**Here's the improved prompt:**

```text
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity:

Text: 'A brief history to provide some perspective:
McCormick Pier was the first substantial project leading to the conversion of the industrial area north of Burnside, resulting in the creation of what is now called The Pearl District. It is the root of The Pearl’s trunk.

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context.
('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. It includes threats, insults, name-calling, hate speech, identity attacks, and excessively offensive language. It also encompasses aggression: subtle forms of hostility.')
('Label type', 'Binary: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 if the text does not contain toxicity.')
('Language', 'English')

Now, let's examine the text for any potentially toxic elements based on the definitions above. Consider the following:

1.  **Identify any phrases or sentences that *could* be interpreted as rude, disrespectful, or aggressive.**
2.  **Analyze each identified phrase/sentence in context.  Explain *why* it might or might not be considered toxic based on the definition provided.**
3.  **Specifically, does the text contain any insults, threats, hate speech, identity attacks, or offensive language? Does it target any individual or group in a disrespectful or aggressive manner?**
4.  **Is there any language that could be considered likely to make someone leave a discussion?**

After careful consideration, determine if the text contains toxicity based on the definitions and analysis above. Provide a confidence score (0-100%) for your classification.

Therefore, the classification is: toxicity: []
Rationale: []
Confidence: []%
```

**Key Changes and Why:**

*   **More detailed instructions for analysis:** The numbered steps guide the model through a more structured reasoning process.
*   **""Identify potential toxicity"":**  This allows the model to explore possibilities rather than just immediately dismissing them.
*   **Contextual analysis:**  The prompt emphasizes the importance of understanding the meaning within the specific context.
*   **Identity Attacks & Aggression:** Expands the definition of toxicity for better coverage.
*   **Rationale & Confidence:** The ""Rationale"" section is *essential* for understanding the model's decision-making. The ""Confidence"" score gives us an idea of how certain the model is in its classification.

This improved prompt should lead to more accurate and insightful classifications. Remember to test it with various types of text to fine-tune it further. Good luck!

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt based on your specifications.

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to determine whether a given text contains toxicity. Toxicity is defined as any language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion.

The text is in English and consists of simple sentences forming a short document.

The label is binary:
- 1: The text contains toxicity.
- 0: The text does not contain toxicity.

You must follow a Chain-of-Thought approach. Before providing the final label, reason step-by-step about the content of the text and whether it exhibits any toxic characteristics. Consider the presence of insults, threats, profanity, hate speech, or any language that could be offensive or divisive. If the text describes negative situations or events without using toxic language, it should not be labeled as toxic.

Here's an example of the reasoning process:

""Let's analyze the text. The text describes [brief summary of the text]. There is no presence of insults, profanity, or any language intended to offend. Therefore, the text does not contain toxicity.""

Now, apply this reasoning to the following text:

"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a chain-of-thought prompt that will help a language model classify a given text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). The prompt should guide the model to first analyze the text for indicators of toxicity (e.g., insults, threats, hate speech, offensive language) and then make a final classification based on its analysis. The language of the text is English.

<prompt>
First, read the text carefully and identify any potentially toxic elements. Consider the following:

*   **Explicitly offensive language:** Are there any swear words, slurs, or derogatory terms used?
*   **Insults and personal attacks:** Does the text contain any insults directed at individuals or groups?
*   **Threats or incitement to violence:** Does the text threaten anyone or encourage violence?
*   **Hate speech:** Does the text express hatred or discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics?
*   **General negativity and hostility:** Even without explicit insults, does the text create a hostile or offensive tone?

Based on your analysis, determine whether the text contains toxicity. If the text contains any of the elements described above, classify it as toxic (1). If the text is generally neutral or positive and does not contain any offensive content, classify it as non-toxic (0).

Now, consider the following questions to determine if the text contains toxicity:

1.  Does the text contain insults, threats, or hate speech directed at any individual or group?
2.  Does the text use offensive language or profanity?
3.  Does the text promote violence or discrimination?
4.  Does the text make unsubstantiated accusations or spread misinformation with malicious intent?
5.  Does the text exhibit a generally hostile, aggressive, or disrespectful tone?

Based on your analysis of the text and your answers to the above questions, determine if the text contains toxicity. If the text contains any of the elements described above, classify it as toxic. Otherwise, classify it as non-toxic.

Finally, provide your answer in the following format: ""toxicity: [ ]"". Place a 1 inside the brackets if the text is toxic, and a 0 if it is not.

"|"Here's an analysis of the text based on the provided questions:

1. **Insults, threats, or hate speech:** There are no direct insults, threats, or hate speech directed at any individual or group. While critical of the OLCC, the language is not explicitly hateful.

2. **Offensive language or profanity:** The text does not contain any offensive language or profanity.

3. **Promotes violence or discrimination:** The text does not promote violence or discrimination.

4. **Unsubstantiated accusations or spread misinformation with malicious intent:** The text makes accusations of hindering and targeting Maria, and implies potential corruption within the OLCC. While these accusations are not substantiated within the text itself, the intent doesn't clearly seem malicious *misinformation* spread. The author seems to be genuinely concerned and believes the OLCC is acting unfairly.

5. **Hostile, aggressive, or disrespectful tone:** The tone is critical and accusatory towards the OLCC. Words like ""hindering,"" ""disheartening,"" ""extremely concerning,"" and ""targeted"" suggest a strong negative sentiment. The text is definitely disrespectful towards the OLCC.

Given the critical and accusatory tone, along with the unsubstantiated accusations against the OLCC, I would classify this text as toxic.

Let's analyze the provided text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a chain-of-thought approach, considering several factors before arriving at the final classification.

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context. We'll consider language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to offend or upset someone. This includes insults, threats, hate speech, and aggressive language.

Now, let's examine the text step by step:

1.  Identify potential indicators of toxicity: Does the text contain any direct insults or name-calling? Does it express hatred or prejudice towards any group or individual? Is there any use of offensive language or slurs? Does it make threats or promote violence? Is the tone generally aggressive or disrespectful?

2.  Contextualize the identified indicators: If any potential indicators are found, consider the context in which they are used. Is the language justified or mitigated by the surrounding text? Is the speaker expressing frustration or anger in a way that is understandable given the situation? Are they targeting someone in a malicious way?

3.  Synthesize the evidence: Based on the analysis of potential indicators and their context, determine whether the text as a whole can be considered toxic. A single instance of mild rudeness might not be enough to classify the text as toxic, whereas a pattern of aggressive and hateful language would clearly indicate toxicity.

4.  Assign the final classification: Based on the synthesis of evidence, assign a binary label: 1 if the text is deemed toxic, 0 if it is not.

In the text: ""Is it not in the best interest of the OLCC to help facilitate Maria & Refuge in procuring a liquor lisence? I was at a private event at Refuge where alcohol was not sold. I was surprised this was the case. Instead, beer & wine were offered at NO CHARGE. Refuge is a beautiful space & a great addition to our city.

The author suggests that Maria is being unfairly targeted and urges the OLCC to provide support rather than hindering her efforts. The tone is critical and accusatory but does not contain insults, threats, hate speech, or other forms of toxicity.

Therefore, the text does not contain toxicity.

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed for classifying the toxicity of a given text, formatted as requested.

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier specializing in identifying toxic language. You will be provided with a text excerpt and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic content. Toxic content is defined as any language that is rude, disrespectful, hurtful, threatening, or intended to offend or demean individuals or groups, or contains profanity.

The text is in English and consists of simple sentences forming a short paragraph.

The label is binary:
-   '1' indicates the presence of toxic content.
-   '0' indicates the absence of toxic content.

Here's how you should approach the task:

1.  Carefully read the provided text.
2.  Analyze the text for any instances of the language described in the definition of toxic content.
3.  If the text contains toxic content as defined above, assign the label '1'. Otherwise, assign the label '0'.
4.  Present your answer in the format: 'toxicity: \[label]'

Example:

Text: ""This is a wonderful and helpful comment.""
Reasoning: The text does not contain rude, disrespectful, hurtful, or offensive language.
Answer: toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You are an idiot and your ideas are terrible!""
Reasoning: The text contains disrespectful and demeaning language.
Answer: toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: 'Is it not in the best interest of the OLCC to help facilitate Maria & Refuge in procuring a liquor lisence?

"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a chain-of-thought prompt that will help classify if a given text contains toxicity or not. The prompt should also include an explanation of what constitutes toxicity in this context and specify the language of the text. Finally, the prompt must lead to an answer format of 'toxicity: []'.

Here's the prompt:

```
 <prompt>
 Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic language.

 Text: 'I have to disagree on this one!  I have 3 pairs and would like more for every day of my cycle. I have a grotesquely heavy period.  I am able to wear these most days without a backup, and I am not weirdly damp down there.  Tampons and pads give me infections, and the cup doesn't work for my weirdly shaped cervix.  This has been a LIFE SAVER for me because I ALWAYS LEAKED from tampons and pads and now I don't. This means being able to leave the house during my period! This was an issue before due to the leaking. My sister has the same deal. So this is great for some women. If you have a heavy period and a leaking problem, I highly recommend these!'

 First, let's define what constitutes ""toxicity"" in this context. We consider a text to be toxic if it contains:

 *   Hate speech: Language that attacks or demeans a group based on attributes like race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other identity aspects.
 *   Threats: Explicit or implicit statements of intent to harm someone.
 *   Insults: Derogatory or offensive language directed at an individual or group.
 *   Harassment: Persistent unwanted attention or intimidation.
 *   Profanity: Vulgar or obscene language used to shock or offend.

 The language of the text is English.

 Now, carefully examine the provided text for any of the elements defined above. Does the text contain hate speech, threats, insults, harassment, or profanity? Justify your answer. Does the text attack or demean any individual or group? Is there any indication of threat or intent to harm someone? Is there any use of offensive terms in the text? Based on your analysis, determine whether the text is toxic or not.

 Finally, provide your answer in the following format:

 toxicity: []
 </prompt>
 ```"|"Here's my analysis:

The text describes a personal experience with a menstrual product and offers a recommendation. It uses phrases like ""grotesquely heavy period"" and ""weirdly shaped cervix,"" but these are descriptive and related to the personal experience being shared, not used to attack or demean anyone. The language is informal but not profane. There are no threats, hate speech, insults, or harassment present. The text expresses relief and satisfaction with a product, and recommends it to others who might have similar experiences.

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, suitable for use with a language model.

<prompt>
First, carefully read the following text and identify any potentially offensive, disrespectful, or harmful language. Consider whether the text contains any personal attacks, insults, threats, hate speech, or derogatory terms. Assess the overall sentiment and tone of the text. Determine if the text aims to demean, harass, or disparage any individual or group based on their personal attributes or characteristics. Finally, based on your analysis, determine whether the text contains toxicity. If the text contains toxicity, assign a value of 1. Otherwise, assign a value of 0.

Text: 'I have to disagree on this one!  I have 3 pairs and would like more for every day of my cycle. I have a grotesquely heavy period.  I am able to wear these most days without a backup, and I am not weirdly damp down there.  Tampons and pads give me infections, and the cup doesn't work for my weirdly shaped cervix.

Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to determine if the text contains any toxic elements.

**Text:** 'I have to disagree on this one!  I have 3 pairs and would like more for every day of my cycle. I have a grotesquely heavy period.  I am able to wear these most days without a backup, and I am not weirdly damp down there.  Tampons and pads give me infections, and the cup doesn't work for my weirdly shaped cervix.

This was an issue before due to the leaking. My sister has the same deal. So this is great for some women. If you have a heavy period and a leaking problem, I highly recommend these!'

First, let's define what we mean by ""toxicity"" in this context.

*   ('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or otherwise negative language that could cause emotional distress or harm to individuals or groups. It includes hate speech, insults, threats, and any language intended to demean, marginalize, or offend.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates the absence of toxicity.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, break down the analysis:

1.  **Identify potentially toxic words or phrases:** Scan the text for words or phrases that might be considered offensive, insulting, or disrespectful. Consider the context in which these words are used.
2.  **Assess the intent:** Determine if the language is intended to harm or offend. Is the speaker trying to demean or attack someone? Or is the language simply descriptive or expressive of personal feelings?
3.  **Evaluate the overall tone:** Consider the overall tone of the text. Is it generally positive, negative, or neutral? Does the tone suggest an intention to cause harm?
4.  **Synthesize the findings:** Based on the above analysis, make a final determination about whether the text contains toxic elements.

Considering the provided text, does it contain any language that meets our definition of toxicity? Does the author express any hate, insults, threats, or demeaning language towards individuals or groups?

"|"Okay, I will generate a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying text toxicity with a binary label.

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences, review style.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the text contains toxic language, including insults, threats, hate speech, or generally offensive content.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1). 0 means not toxic, 1 means toxic.

**Language of the text:** English

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. I will provide you with a text, and your task is to determine if it contains any toxic elements such as insults, threats, hate speech, or offensive language. You should reason step-by-step to justify your answer. Finally, you must provide the classification in the format: ""toxicity: [ ]"", inserting either 0 or 1 within the brackets. 0 means the text is not toxic, and 1 means the text is toxic.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a wonderful product! I highly recommend it to everyone.""
Reasoning: The text expresses a positive opinion and contains no offensive or harmful language. Therefore, it is not toxic.
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You are the dumbest person I have ever met. Your ideas are idiotic and you should be ashamed.""
Reasoning: The text contains insults and offensive language directed at a person. This constitutes toxic behavior.
toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: 'I have to disagree on this one! I have 3 pairs and would like more for every day of my cycle. I have a grotesquely heavy period. I am able to wear these most days without a backup, and I am not weirdly damp down there. Tampons and pads give me infections, and the cup doesn't work for my weirdly shaped cervix.

"|1.0|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, along with explanations as requested:

**Explanation:**

*   **Label Explanation:** The task is binary classification. '1' represents the presence of toxicity in the text, while '0' indicates its absence. Toxicity can manifest as insults, threats, hate speech, or generally abusive language.
*   **Language:** The language of the text is English.
*   **Chain-of-Thought:** The prompt guides the model to first identify potential indicators of toxicity (insults, threats, etc.), then to consider the context and overall tone, and finally to make a definitive classification. This step-by-step approach encourages more accurate and reliable results.

Identify the language of the text.

Based on your analysis, does the text contain elements that could be considered offensive, aggressive, or harmful? Explain your reasoning. Consider the overall context and intent of the message.

Finally, classify the text as either toxic (1) or not toxic (0). Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

    *   **Disrespectful Statements:** Dismissing someone's opinion as ""crap.""

*   **Reasoning:**

    The text uses derogatory terms (""fool,"" ""crap"") to belittle both a hypothetical person and their opinion. While the sender claims it's not their true sentiment, the use of insults, regardless of stated intent, is aggressive and can be offensive. The phrase ""Your post is total crap"" is a direct and disrespectful dismissal of someone else's contribution. The final smiley face doesn't negate the preceding insults.

Now, let's break down the process of determining if this text contains toxicity. Consider these aspects:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** Scan the text for words or phrases that could be considered insulting, disrespectful, or abusive. Note any instances of name-calling, insults, or personal attacks.

2.  **Assess the context and intent:** Determine whether the potentially offensive language is used in a joking or sarcastic manner, or whether it is genuinely intended to harm or offend. Pay attention to any disclaimers or qualifiers that may mitigate the offensiveness.

3.  **Evaluate the overall tone and sentiment:** Consider the overall tone of the text. Is it generally positive, negative, or neutral? Does the text express anger, hostility, or contempt?

4.  **Make a final determination:** Based on your analysis of the offensive language, context, intent, and overall tone, decide whether the text contains toxicity. If the text contains language that is likely to be perceived as harmful, offensive, or abusive, classify it as toxic. Otherwise, classify it as non-toxic.

- **1 (Toxic):** The text includes harmful, offensive, or disrespectful language, insults, or aggressive tone.  
- **0 (Non-Toxic):** The text is neutral, respectful, or does not contain harmful intent, even if it includes casual or informal language.  

**Language of the Text:** English (informal, conversational tone with potential sarcasm or mock toxicity).  

**Instructions:**  
1. Read the text carefully and identify any toxic elements (e.g., insults, aggression, harmful intent).  
2. Ignore disclaimers or meta-comments (e.g., ""just giving you a crap comment"") if they do not reflect the actual toxicity of the text.  
3. Focus on the literal meaning and tone of the statements.  
4. Output only the label in the format: `toxicity: [1/0]`.

toxicity: [0]"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, incorporating the requested elements:

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to identify potentially toxic elements and then provide a final classification.

**Text:** 'THIS IS A TEST: 

Any fool knows Star Trek is the best albeit lacking the technology available to more recent shows. Your post is total crap. 

That's not what I really think or how I talk...just giving you a crap comment :)'

Here's how we'll break it down:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** Scan the text for words or phrases that are commonly used to insult, demean, or threaten individuals or groups.

2.  **Analyze the intent behind the language:** Consider the context in which the words are used. Is the intent to harm, offend, or provoke?  Are they directed at a specific person or group?

3.  **Evaluate the overall tone:**  Is the tone of the text aggressive, disrespectful, or hostile? Does it create a negative or uncomfortable environment?

4.  **Contextual Considerations:** Acknowledge disclaimers like ""That's not what I really think or how I talk...just giving you a crap comment :)"" to understand the true intention.

Based on this analysis and the above text. Let's consider the following:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone upset.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: 1 indicates presence of toxicity, 0 indicates absence of toxicity.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, provide your final classification using the following format:

toxicity: []
<\prompt>
"|1.0|"Here's an analysis of the text and the final classification:

1. **Potentially Offensive Words/Phrases:** The text contains ""fool,"" ""crap,"" and ""total crap."" These phrases are generally considered insulting and disrespectful.

2. **Intent Analysis:** The phrase ""Your post is total crap"" is a direct insult aimed at the recipient of the post. While the subsequent disclaimer attempts to mitigate this, the initial intent appears to be critical and somewhat aggressive. The phrase ""Any fool knows..."" is also condescending.

3. **Overall Tone:** The initial tone is negative and critical. The disclaimer at the end attempts to lighten the tone, but the initial impact is still negative.

4. **Contextual Considerations:** The disclaimer ""That's not what I really think or how I talk...just giving you a crap comment :)"" indicates the author is aware that the comment is potentially offensive and that their normal communication style is different. This somewhat reduces the severity, but doesn't eliminate the toxicity entirely. It suggests that the author is intentionally adopting a negative persona for the sake of the ""crap comment.""

Given these factors, the text exhibits elements of toxicity, albeit mitigated by the disclaimer. The use of insulting language and a condescending tone, even if disclaimed later, contributes to a negative and potentially upsetting experience for the reader.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the given text contains toxic content. Toxic content includes insults, threats, offensive language, and disrespectful comments.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (either toxic or not toxic).

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxicity in text. Read the following text and determine if it contains any toxic content such as insults, threats, offensive language, or disrespectful comments. Think step by step. First, identify any potentially toxic words or phrases. Second, assess the overall context and intent of the text. Third, determine whether the text is likely to be perceived as offensive or harmful by a reasonable person. Finally, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or not toxic (0). Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

Text: 'THIS IS A TEST: 

Any fool knows Star Trek is the best albeit lacking the technology available to more recent shows. Your post is total crap. 

That's not what I really think or how I talk...just giving you a crap comment :)'.
</prompt>
"|1.0|"Here's my analysis:

1.  **Potentially Toxic Words/Phrases:** ""fool,"" ""total crap,"" ""crap comment.""

2.  **Context and Intent:** The text starts with an assertive statement (""Any fool knows Star Trek is the best..."") and follows with a dismissive remark (""Your post is total crap.""). While the final sentence attempts to soften the impact by stating it's not a genuine opinion, the initial negative statements could still be perceived as offensive.

3.  **Likelihood of Offense:** A reasonable person might find the phrases ""fool"" and ""total crap"" insulting and disrespectful, even with the disclaimer at the end. The intent might be playful, but the initial impact is negative.

4.  **Conclusion:** Given the presence of potentially offensive language and the risk of being perceived as disrespectful, I classify the text as toxic.

KrisAnns Hall gives the Constitutional argument

https://youtu.be/T424sWq1SkE'

First, let's define what we mean by ""toxicity"" in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Text that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel attacked or offended. This includes hate speech, threats, and insults.')
*   ('Toxicity Level', 'Binary: 1 indicates presence of toxic content, 0 indicates absence of toxic content')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, consider the following aspects of the text:

1.  **Explicitly Toxic Language:** Does the text contain insults, slurs, or profanity directed at individuals or groups?
2.  **Threats or Incitement:** Does the text threaten violence or incite hatred towards any person or group?
3.  **Targeted Attacks:** Does the text personally attack an individual based on their identity or beliefs?
4.  **Disrespectful Language:** Does the text use disrespectful or demeaning language towards any person or group?
5.  **Neutral Content:** If the text mainly presents factual information or opinions without being offensive, it is likely not toxic.

Based on the above analysis of the provided text, does it contain toxicity as defined above?

Now, provide your final classification using the following format:

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Let's analyze the text step-by-step:

1. **Explicitly Toxic Language:** The text doesn't contain any insults, slurs, or profanity. It primarily quotes a section of the U.S. Constitution.

2. **Threats or Incitement:** The text does not threaten violence or incite hatred.

3. **Targeted Attacks:** The text doesn't directly attack any individual based on their identity or beliefs. While it mentions ""KrisAnns Hall"" and links to a YouTube video, there's no evidence within the provided text itself of a targeted attack.

4. **Disrespectful Language:** The language used is formal and legalistic, drawing directly from the U.S. Constitution. There's no disrespectful or demeaning language used.

5. **Neutral Content:** The text mainly presents a question about the foundation of a protest, a constitutional argument, and a link to a video. The constitutional quote itself is neutral. Without viewing the linked video, it's impossible to comment on its content, but the text provided is not inherently toxic.

Based on this analysis, the text does not contain toxicity.

3.  **Determine the overall toxicity:** Based on your analysis, decide whether the text contains toxicity.
4.  **Provide the toxicity label**: Assign a binary label to the text. The label '1' indicates the presence of toxicity, while the label '0' indicates the absence of toxicity.

The text will be in simple sentences, or in a document format. The labels are binary, and the language of the text is English.

The 'toxicity' label indicates whether the provided text contains toxic language. A value of '1' means the text contains toxicity, while a value of '0' means it does not.

Here's an example:

Text: ""I think you're wrong.""
This text is not toxic, it's just an opinion.
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You are a stupid idiot and nobody likes you.""
This text contains insults and is thus toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: 'What is the foundation of the Harney County protest

U.S. Constitution Article 1, Section 8, Paragraph 17

Let's think step by step. First, carefully analyze the provided text for any signs of offensive language, insults, threats, hate speech, or targeting of individuals or groups. Pay close attention to the context in which words are used, as the same word can be toxic in one situation and harmless in another. Identify specific words, phrases, or sentiments that contribute to a toxic or non-toxic environment. Determine if the text as a whole presents toxicity.

**Chain of Thought Prompt for Toxicity Classification**

**Task:** Classify whether the given text contains toxicity (1) or not (0).  

**Label Explanation:**  
- **1 (Toxic):** The text contains harmful, offensive, or aggressive language, including insults, slurs, or hostile intent.  
- **0 (Non-Toxic):** The text is neutral, respectful, or does not exhibit harmful intent.  

**Language of the Text:** English (informal, conversational tone with potential aggressive undertones).  

**Instructions:**  
1. Read the text carefully and identify any words, phrases, or tones that could be considered toxic (e.g., insults, hostility, offensive language).  
2. Focus on the intent and emotional charge of the text, not just surface-level negativity.  
3. If the text includes toxicity, respond with ""toxicity: [1]"". If not, respond with ""toxicity: [0]"".  

**Example Output:**  
toxicity: []

1. **Initial Tone and Language**: The text starts with ""How the hell can people..."", which is an aggressive and confrontational opening phrase. ""How the hell"" is generally considered rude or hostile in tone.

2. **Content Analysis**: The text expresses frustration about people moving to Oregon (specifically Portland) from outside the Northwest, implying they shouldn't have been involved in legalization efforts. This carries an exclusionary undertone.

3. **Hostility Indicators**: The phrase ""not even FROM OREGON"" (in all caps) emphasizes anger or resentment, and the overall tone suggests hostility toward outsiders.

4. **Generalization**: The statement generalizes about ""2/3 of the people"" in a negative context, which could be seen as prejudiced against non-locals.

While the text doesn't contain explicit slurs or direct insults, the aggressive tone, confrontational language, and hostile intent toward a group of people qualify as toxic under the given definition.

Here's the breakdown of labels and their definitions:

- ('Toxicity', 'Presence of rude, disrespectful, or otherwise offensive language or personal attacks directed at an individual or group.')
- ('Label type', 'Binary: 1 if toxic, 0 if non-toxic')
- ('Language', 'English')

""You must not live within 50 miles Portland because I nearly 2/3 of the people I talk to came from somewhere outside the NW.""

First, identify any potentially offensive words or phrases. Does the phrase ""How the hell"" indicate anger or frustration? Does the comment ""not even FROM OREGON"" suggest prejudice or resentment toward people who moved in? Does the second sentence contains offensive content?

Second, consider the overall tone and intent of the text. Is the author primarily expressing disagreement or frustration, or are they attempting to insult or demean a particular group of people? Is there any specific target of toxicity?

Third, based on your analysis of the language, tone, and intent, make a judgment about whether the text is toxic. Does the text contains toxicity?

**Step 1: Identify Potentially Offensive Words and Phrases**

*   ""How the hell"": This phrase indicates anger and frustration, which can contribute to a negative tone.
*   ""not even FROM OREGON"": This comment suggests resentment toward people who have moved to Oregon. It implies that only native Oregonians should have a say in Oregon matters, which is a form of nativism.
*   ""You must not live within 50 miles Portland because I nearly 2/3 of the people I talk to came from somewhere outside the NW."" This sentence can be considered as an accusatory and dismissive statement.

**Step 2: Consider Overall Tone and Intent**

The overall tone is one of frustration, resentment, and possibly a sense of superiority. The author seems to be directing their anger at people who moved to Oregon.

**Step 3: Judgment about Toxicity**

The text expresses resentment toward people who moved to Oregon. This contributes to toxicity.

First, analyze the following text and determine if it contains any toxic elements such as insults, offensive language, or prejudiced statements. Consider the context of the text when making your assessment. Then, classify the toxicity of the provided text using a binary classification system. If the text contains toxic elements, assign a value of '1'. If the text does not contain toxic elements, assign a value of '0'.

Let's think step by step. The text expresses frustration and resentment towards people who have moved to Oregon. It uses the phrase ""How the hell,"" which, while not a severe insult, indicates strong negative emotion. The comment seems to criticize newcomers based on their origin (""not even FROM OREGON""). This could be interpreted as a form of prejudice or hostility toward outsiders. Given these considerations, does the text contain elements that could be considered toxic? Yes.

"|"The text contains strong negative sentiment towards Bundy and his group, labeling them as ""terrorists"". It also suggests severe punishment, including indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay. While it expresses disapproval of their actions rather than targeting a protected group, the language used (""terrorists"", ""should be held without bail at GITMO"") and the endorsement of extreme measures can be considered toxic due to its potential to incite hatred or violence.

First, carefully read the following text: ""Screw Bundy and his gang of terrorists. They should be held without bail at GITMO along with other terrorists. There are ways of seeking redress for your grievances but their choice is neither legal or moral."".

Now, let's analyze the text step-by-step to determine if it contains toxicity:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** Does the text contain insults, slurs, hate speech, or other offensive language?
2.  **Assess the target of the language:** Is the language directed at an individual, a group, or a concept? Is the target attacked in a personal or demeaning way?
3.  **Consider the severity of the language:** Is the language mild, moderate, or severe in its offensiveness? Does it promote violence or discrimination?
4.  **Determine the overall tone of the text:** Is the text generally negative, aggressive, or hostile?
5.  **Based on the above analysis, does the text contain toxicity?**
Based on the above analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity or not. Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, including the requested label definitions and format.

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier, skilled at identifying toxic language in online text. You will receive a text passage and must determine whether it contains toxicity. Follow the steps below:

1.  **Understand the Task**: The goal is to identify if the provided text contains toxic language, including hate speech, threats, insults, or disparaging remarks.

2.  **Consider the Definitions**:
    *   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, hurtful, or likely to make someone want to leave a discussion. It may include insults, threats, name-calling, or hate speech.')
    *   ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, 0 indicates the absence of toxicity.')
    *   ('Language', 'English')

3.  **Analyze the Text**: Carefully examine the provided text for any instances of the toxic language. Consider the context and intent behind the words. Pay attention to:
    *   Explicitly offensive words or phrases.
    *   Implicitly offensive language (e.g., coded hate speech).
    *   Targeting of individuals or groups with malicious intent.
    *   Use of stereotypes and generalizations.
    *   Threats of violence or harm.

4.  **Determine Toxicity**: Based on your analysis, determine whether the text contains toxic content. If any element of the text matches the definition of toxicity, classify the text as toxic.

5.  **Provide the Output**: Output only in the format: `toxicity: []`. Place a `1` inside the brackets if the text contains toxicity, and a `0` if it does not. Do not include any additional explanation or justification.

Here is the text to classify:

('Label type', 'Binary classification')
('Language', 'English')
<\prompt>
"|1.0|"Okay, I understand. Based on the provided examples, it seems the toxicity label is determined by the presence of:

*   **Direct insults or personal attacks:** Calling someone an idiot, saying nobody likes them, or telling them to be ashamed.
*   **Explicitly negative and aggressive language:** Use of words like ""terrible"" combined with personal attacks.

And the absence of:

*   **Expressions of positive sentiment:** Saying something is great and enjoyable.
*   **Expressions of personal frustration:**  Expressing feelings about traffic.

Given this, I can make an educated guess about the toxicity label for the following text:

""Screw Bundy and his gang of terrorists. They should be held without bail at GITMO along with other terrorists. There are ways of seeking redress for your grievances but their choice is neither legal or moral.""

**My assessment:  toxicity: [1]**

**Reasoning:**

*   The text starts with ""Screw,"" which is a vulgarity and indicates strong negative sentiment.
*   It labels people as ""terrorists,"" which is a highly charged and negative term.
*   It expresses the desire for them to be held without bail at GITMO, implying harsh punishment.

Even though the last sentence attempts to justify the statement by pointing out the illegal and immoral nature of their choice, the overall sentiment is aggressive and accusatory, making it toxic according to the given examples.

"|"Here's an analysis of the provided text, breaking down potential issues:

*   **Step 1: Identify potentially offensive words or phrases.**

    *   ""sh*t"": This is profanity.
    *   ""squatters"": While not inherently offensive, the term can be used pejoratively to dehumanize individuals.
    *   ""rot outside"": This phrase dehumanizes individuals, implying they are decaying and worthless.
    *   ""illiberal jerk"": This is an insult directed at someone who might disagree with the author.
    *   ""killing them with your kindness"": This phrase, while metaphorical, implies that the actions of the Mayor are harmful and irresponsible, potentially inciting anger and resentment.
    *   ""Drug Dealers"": This can promote negative stereotypes.
    *   ""armed guards"": This suggests a violent approach to the situation.

*   **Step 2: Analyze the context in which these words/phrases are used.**

    *   ""sh*t"": Used to describe an act of public defecation, potentially expressing disgust and anger towards those responsible.
    *   ""squatters,"" ""rot outside"": Used to describe homeless individuals struggling with mental illness or addiction. This paints them in a negative and demeaning light.
    *   ""illiberal jerk"": Used to preemptively dismiss potential criticism and label opponents.
    *   ""killing them with your kindness"": Used to criticize the Mayor's policies, implying they are ineffective and harmful.
    *   ""Drug Dealers"": Used to contextualize why public bathrooms are not being used, but is likely used to blame this group.
    *   ""armed guards"": Used as a final warning/statement.

*   **Step 3: Determine if the language targets any specific group or individual in a negative way.**

    *   The text targets homeless individuals struggling with mental illness or addiction, portraying them as a problem and using dehumanizing language (""rot outside"").
    *   It targets the Mayor, accusing them of ineffective and harmful policies.
    *   Potentially targets Drug Dealers.
    *   Potentially targets anyone with disagreement with the author (calling them an ""illiberal jerk"").

*   **Step 4: Assess the overall tone and intent of the message.**

    *   The overall tone is angry, frustrated, and accusatory. The intent appears to be to criticize the Mayor's policies on homelessness and potentially incite action or support for a different approach. The text employs dehumanizing language and insults to strengthen its argument and dismiss opposing viewpoints. The P.S. suggests potential for violence and escalated action.

*   **Step 5: Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).**

    Based on the use of profanity, dehumanizing language targeting vulnerable populations, insults, accusatory tone, and the suggestion of violence, the text is considered toxic.

"|"This is a great start! Your explanation of the design choices is also excellent. Here are some suggestions to further enhance the prompt and its explanation:

**Enhancements to the Few-Shot Prompt:**

*   **Subtler Toxicity:** Include an example with subtle toxicity, like passive-aggression or microaggressions.  This will challenge the model to identify less obvious forms of harmful language.

*   **Context Matters Example:** Include an example where a word *could* be toxic, but isn't in the given context. For example, using a potentially offensive term in a historical or academic discussion.

*   **Edge Case Example:** An example that's ambiguous or could be interpreted either way.  This helps the model understand the nuances of toxicity. This should also include a filled bracket in the answer, either [0] or [1]

Answer: toxicity: [1]

**Revised Explanation of Design Choices:**

*   **Clear Task Definition:** The initial prompt explicitly states the task: ""Classify, with 1 or 0, if the text contains toxicity or not.""
*   **Format Adherence:**  The prompt examples strictly adhere to the `toxicity: [ ]` output format.
*   **Diverse Examples:** The examples include positive, negative, and neutral sentiments to provide a balanced training set for the model.  This increases the model's ability to generalize to different forms of toxicity and non-toxic content. The examples includes the prompt request.
*   **Simple Language:** The examples use simple and direct language to make it easier for the model to understand the task.
*   **Subtle Toxicity:** Includes an example demonstrating passive-aggressive behavior to challenge the model's ability to detect less obvious forms of toxicity.
*   **Contextual Sensitivity:** Includes an example where a potentially offensive word is used in a non-offensive context (historical reference). This highlights the importance of considering context when assessing toxicity.
*   **Ambiguous Cases:** An attempt was made to include an edge case example that is subjective and open to interpretation, further testing the model's nuanced understanding of toxicity.
*   **Representitive Toxicity:** More instances of real world toxicity are presented.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Prompt Length:** Be mindful of the prompt length limitations of the model you are using.  Too many examples can exceed the input token limit.  If this is a problem, consider reducing the length of some examples or decreasing the number of examples.

*   **Experimentation:** Try different combinations of examples to see which ones yield the best results.  The optimal prompt often depends on the specific model being used.

*   **False Positives/Negatives:** Think about the types of errors that would be most costly in your application. Are you more concerned about falsely labeling something as toxic, or missing actual toxic content? Tailor your examples to address these concerns.  If false positives are particularly bad, include more examples of non-toxic content.

By incorporating these suggestions, you can create an even more robust and effective few-shot prompt for text toxicity classification. Remember that experimentation is key to finding the optimal prompt for your specific use case!
"|"Okay, I will create a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying the toxicity of the provided text.

<prompt>
First, read the following text carefully and identify any sentences or phrases that express hateful, disrespectful, or offensive sentiments. Consider the context and target of the potentially toxic language. Then, analyze whether the overall tone and content of the text promotes discrimination, prejudice, or violence towards any individual or group. Finally, based on your analysis, classify the text as either containing toxicity (1) or not containing toxicity (0).

toxicity: []
<\prompt>
"|"Here's an analysis of the provided text, identifying potentially toxic elements and classifying the overall content:

**Analysis of Potentially Toxic Elements:**

*   **""they sh\*t in his doorway""**: While not inherently hateful, this phrase is vulgar and expresses disgust towards an unknown group of people who are assumed to be squatters or drug users.
*   **""Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business""**: This generalizes and potentially stereotypes drug dealers as controlling and inconsiderate, creating a negative association with this group.
*   **""Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.""**: This is a highly problematic statement. It uses dehumanizing language (""rot"") to describe individuals struggling with mental illness and addiction. It suggests neglect and promotes a lack of empathy towards a vulnerable population.
*   **""YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness.""**: This is accusatory and implies that compassionate policies are harmful, potentially justifying harsher treatment of vulnerable individuals.
*   **""If you think I’m an illiberal jerk, I’ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.""**: While the language on its own is not toxic, its inclusion feels defensive and potentially dismissive of criticism by suggesting a commitment to a particular political ideology as justification for potentially harmful views.
*   **""Would you prefer a locked gate or armed guards?""**: This poses a loaded question that implies a need for aggressive measures to control a particular group, possibly those mentioned earlier (squatters, drug users), which can be interpreted as promoting fear and hostility.

**Overall Tone and Content:**

The overall tone is harsh, judgmental, and lacks empathy. The text singles out vulnerable groups (squatters, individuals with mental illness or addiction) and uses demeaning language to describe their situation. It promotes a potentially hostile attitude towards these individuals and suggests that compassionate approaches are ineffective or even harmful. The text expresses a strong opinion about how to deal with a specific issue, but it does so in a way that is likely to cause offense and perpetuate negative stereotypes.

**Classification:**

Based on the analysis, the text contains toxicity due to its dehumanizing language, promotion of negative stereotypes, and overall lack of empathy towards vulnerable individuals.

1. **Insults/Demeaning Language**:  
   - The phrase ""YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness"" is accusatory and hyperbolic, implying negligence.  
   - The sarcastic remark ""If you think I’m an illiberal jerk"" is defensive but not directly insulting others.  
   - The rhetorical question ""P.S. Would you prefer a locked gate or armed guards?"" carries an aggressive tone, implying extreme solutions.  

2. **Hostility/Aggression**:  
   - The text criticizes policies and individuals (Mayor Hales, Democrats) with strong language (""killing them with your kindness""), which could be seen as hostile.  
   - The phrase ""rot outside"" is dehumanizing toward squatters, reflecting aggression.  

3. **Harmful Intent**:  
   - While the text discusses a serious issue (homelessness, drug use), it frames the argument in a polarizing way, blaming specific groups (""YOU and Mayor Hales"") rather than constructively addressing the problem.  

**Conclusion**: The text contains demeaning language, hostility, and accusatory rhetoric, which align with the criteria for toxicity.

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Identify potentially toxic words/phrases:** Scan the text for any words or phrases that are offensive, disrespectful, or abusive.  Consider slurs, insults, threats, and aggressive language. Note any instances of profanity.
2.  **Assess the target of the toxicity:** Determine if the potentially toxic language is directed at an individual, a group, or a concept. Is there a specific victim of the toxicity?
3.  **Evaluate the severity of the toxicity:**  Determine the intensity of the toxic language. Is it mild, moderate, or severe?  Consider the context in which the language is used.
4.  **Consider the overall tone and intent:** Analyze the overall tone of the text. Is it primarily intended to be offensive, or is the toxic language used within a broader argument or discussion? Consider if the user is trying to offend someone.
5.  **Classify based on the presence and degree of toxicity:** Based on the preceding analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity.

    *   If the text contains offensive language, targets a specific individual or group with negativity, and/or has an overall offensive tone, then the text is classified as toxic.
    *   If the text contains no offensive language, does not target anyone negatively, and maintains a respectful tone, then the text is classified as non-toxic. Note that disagreement or criticism is not necessarily toxic.

toxicity: []

Explanation of the label:
The label is a binary classification indicating whether the text contains toxicity (1) or not (0).
Toxicity includes:
- Use of offensive words
- Hate speech
- Threats
- Insults

Definition of the type of the label:
Binary Classification (0 or 1)

Language of the text:
English
</prompt>
"||"Okay, I understand. Based on the provided examples and definitions, I can analyze text and classify it for toxicity.  I will look for indicators like:

*   **Explicitly offensive words or slurs.**
*   **Personal insults and attacks.**
*   **Threats of violence or harm.**
*   **Hate speech targeting specific groups.**
*   **Statements promoting discrimination or prejudice.**

If none of these indicators are present, I will classify the text as non-toxic (0). If any of them are present, I will classify the text as toxic (1).

I am ready for more text to classify. I will also take into consideration the nuance of language and try to avoid false positives (classifying non-toxic text as toxic).
"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for classifying text toxicity, following the specified format and including the requested information.

<prompt>
You are an expert in detecting toxicity in text. You will be provided with a text excerpt and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic content or not.

The text is in English and consists of a paragraph extracted from a document, written using simple sentences.

The label you need to provide is 'toxicity'. The 'toxicity' label is a binary classification:

*   **1**: The text contains toxic content (e.g., hate speech, offensive language, threats, insults, disparaging remarks, etc.).
*   **0**: The text does not contain toxic content.

Consider the following examples to guide your decision-making process:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Text: ""This is a friendly and polite message.""
    *   Reasoning: The text expresses a positive sentiment and does not contain any harmful or offensive language. Therefore, it is not toxic.
    *   Answer: toxicity: [0]
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Text: ""You are a stupid idiot and I hate you.""
    *   Reasoning: The text contains insults and expresses hatred, which are clear indicators of toxicity.
    *   Answer: toxicity: [1]
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Text: ""The article discusses the economic impact of climate change.""
    *   Reasoning: The text presents factual information and does not contain any harmful or offensive language. Therefore, it is not toxic.
    *   Answer: toxicity: [0]
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Text: ""All members of that group are lazy and dishonest.""
    *   Reasoning: The text contains generalization and negative stereotypes. Therefore, it is toxic.
    *   Answer: toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text and determine its toxicity level. Remember to justify your answer with reasoning about the presence or absence of toxic elements.

Text: 'Part 3
The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business.

First, identify any potentially toxic language or sentiments expressed in the text. Then, based on your analysis, determine whether the text contains toxic content. Finally, provide your answer in the specified format:

toxicity: []
<\prompt>
"|1.0|"The text contains several potentially toxic elements:

1.  The phrase ""why they sh*t in his doorway"" is crude and offensive, even with the censored word.
2.  The statement ""Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion"" is dehumanizing and insensitive towards vulnerable individuals. It implies they are better off dead (""rot outside"").
3.  The phrase ""killing them with your kindness"" is accusatory.
4.  The phrase ""illiberal jerk"" is derogatory.

Overall, the text contains offensive language, dehumanizing sentiments, and accusatory statements, making it toxic.

<prompt>
**Task:** Classify whether a given text contains toxicity.

**Label Explanation:**

*   **1:** The text contains toxic language, including hate speech, threats, insults, or any content intended to demean, marginalize, or harm individuals or groups.
*   **0:** The text does not contain toxic language. It may express disagreement, criticism, or negative sentiment, but it does not cross the line into toxicity as defined above.

**Language:** English

**Examples:**

Text: ""You are a complete idiot and I hate everything you say.""
Answer: toxicity: [1]

Text: ""I strongly disagree with your opinion on this matter. I think you are wrong.""
Answer: toxicity: [0]

Text: ""This is a reasonable point, but I think there are other factors to consider.""
Answer: toxicity: [0]

Text: ""Shut your mouth, you worthless piece of trash.""

"|"toxicity: [0]
"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, specifically tailored to the given instructions.

**Explanation of the Label:**

*   **toxicity:** This label indicates whether the text contains language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to offend or upset someone. It encompasses insults, threats, hate speech, and generally aggressive or malicious statements. A value of '1' signifies the presence of toxic language, while '0' indicates its absence.

**Language of the text:**

*   English

<prompt>
First, carefully read the following text: ""Considering the real facts of this issue, I believe that it was inappropriate for the informant to report this ""scandal"" to the media. In my opinion, the informant most likely has a personal vendetta with individuals in the school. Or it is a common case of parental gossip. (Definition of gossip: casual or unconstrained conversation or reports about other people, typically involving details that are not confirmed as being true). If the freshman were dangerous to the community, he would have been removed from the school permanently. Though it was a stupid decision to create a ""hit list,"" one must take into account that teenagers react to hormones in different ways."".

Now, break down the text to identify any potentially toxic elements. Consider whether the text contains:

*   Insults or name-calling
*   Threats or aggressive statements
*   Hate speech or discriminatory language
*   Disrespectful or rude remarks
*   Any language intended to offend or upset

Based on your analysis, determine if the text exhibits toxicity. If the text contains any of the above elements, classify it as toxic. If the text is neutral and does not contain any offensive or harmful language, classify it as non-toxic.

Finally, output your classification in the following format:

toxicity: []

Fill the square brackets with either '1' (if toxic) or '0' (if non-toxic).
<\prompt>
"|"Here's an analysis of the text and the toxicity classification:

**Analysis:**

*   **Insults or name-calling:** The text doesn't directly use insults or name-calling. However, calling the creation of a ""hit list"" a ""stupid decision"" could be interpreted as mildly insulting, but it's primarily descriptive of an action.
*   **Threats or aggressive statements:** The text contains no direct threats or aggressive statements.
*   **Hate speech or discriminatory language:** There is no hate speech or discriminatory language present.
*   **Disrespectful or rude remarks:** The tone is somewhat dismissive of the situation and the informant. The phrases ""personal vendetta"" and ""parental gossip"" suggest a negative motive without concrete evidence, which can be considered disrespectful.
*   **Language intended to offend or upset:** While not overtly offensive, the text could be upsetting to someone who believes the ""scandal"" was a serious matter, as it downplays the significance and questions the informant's motives. It could also be offensive to those who think the ""hit list"" shouldn't be dismissed so easily with the excuse of ""teenagers react to hormones in different ways.""

**Overall:**

The text doesn't contain explicitly toxic elements like hate speech or direct threats. However, it contains elements that could be considered disrespectful, dismissive, and potentially offensive depending on the reader's perspective. It questions motives without proof and downplays a potentially serious situation. Therefore, it leans towards being toxic.

"|"This is a great start!  The examples are well-chosen and represent different facets of toxicity and non-toxicity.  The format is also perfect.

However, to further improve the prompt and ensure it generalizes well, consider these points:

*   **Edge Cases:**  Include examples that are *borderline* toxic.  This helps the model understand the nuance and subtlety involved in identifying toxicity. For example, slightly sarcastic or passive-aggressive comments.
*   **Specific Contextual Clues:**  Since you are likely working with a specific domain (like online comments or social media), try to use examples that reflect the types of language and discussions common in that domain.
*   **Negation/Irony:** Include a case where seemingly positive language is used in a sarcastic or ironic way to express toxicity. This can be tricky, but some models can pick up on it.
*   **Length Variation:** Use texts of different lengths, similar to the lengths you expect in the real data. You've already done this to some extent.
*   **Diversity of Target:**  The model should be able to identify toxicity directed at different targets: individuals, groups, ideas, etc. Your current examples mainly target individuals.
*  **Potential Bias:** Consider whether your examples might inadvertently reinforce existing biases related to gender, race, religion, etc.

Let's see how we can modify this to incorporate some of these suggestions!

Here's a revised prompt incorporating some of these improvements:

```

Though it was a stupid decision to create a ""hit list,"" one must take into account that teenagers react to hormones in different ways.""
Answer: toxicity: []
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Added borderline toxic examples:**  The phrases ""Ugh, another article about *that* group. Can't they just go away already?"" and  ""Oh, *brilliant* idea. That's exactly what we needed to make this situation even worse."" are more subtle forms of toxicity, relying on sarcasm, generalization, and the implication that a group is unwanted.
*   **Example of toxicity toward a group:** The ""another article..."" example targets a group instead of an individual.
*   **An example of potentially toxic dismissal:**  The ""I just don't understand why people get so upset..."" example is included to show that minimizing someone's experience doesn't automatically make it toxic, but depends on context.
*   **Increased the number of few-shot examples:** The increased number of examples (now 7) helps the model understand the nuances better.

Remember to continue iterating and refining your prompt based on the model's performance and the specific requirements of your task. Good luck!

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to break down the text and identify any potentially toxic elements.

**Text:** 'Considering the real facts of this issue, I believe that it was inappropriate for the informant to report this ""scandal"" to the media. In my opinion, the informant most likely has a personal vendetta with individuals in the school. Or it is a common case of parental gossip. (Definition of gossip: casual or unconstrained conversation or reports about other people, typically involving details that are not confirmed as being true). If the freshman were dangerous to the community, he would have been removed from the school permanently. Though it was a stupid decision to create a ""hit list,"" one must take into account that teenagers react to hormones in different ways.'

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Identify potentially toxic keywords or phrases:** Scan the text for words or phrases that are commonly associated with toxicity, such as insults, threats, hate speech, or disparaging remarks. Consider if the language targets specific individuals or groups.

2.  **Assess the intent and tone:** Evaluate the overall tone of the text. Is it aggressive, dismissive, or disrespectful? Does the author appear to be trying to harm or demean others? Consider the context of the statement.

3.  **Determine the presence of personal attacks:** Check if the text contains attacks on someone's character, intelligence, or appearance. Look for attempts to belittle or humiliate individuals.

4.  **Consider the target of the potential toxicity:** Is the toxicity directed at an individual, a group, or an idea? Understanding the target can help assess the severity of the toxicity.

5.  **Apply the definition of toxicity:** Use the following understanding of toxicity: Toxicity refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, dismissive, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion.

6.  **Final Judgment:** Based on the previous steps, make a final determination. Does the text contain toxicity?

Now, let's apply the labels:

*   ('Label definition', 'Toxicity: Language that is rude, disrespectful, dismissive, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: 0 (not toxic) or 1 (toxic)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Based on this analysis, does the text contain toxicity?

"||"Okay, I understand. Based on the examples provided, I can infer the following rules for classifying text toxicity:

*   **Toxicity (1):** Text that contains negative generalizations, stereotypes, or accusatory statements directed towards a group of people (e.g., political affiliation). This includes opinions framed in a way that feels like an attack or belittles a group.
*   **Non-Toxicity (0):** Text that expresses neutral opinions, promotes understanding, suggests compromise, or presents factual information without targeting or attacking a specific group.
*   **Neutral/Unclear:** Text that presents an argument or an opinion that is not aimed at any particular group of people.

It seems that the core indicator of toxicity is the presence of negativity directed at a particular social group.

I will provide the classification in the format ""toxicity: [0]"" or ""toxicity: [1]"".
"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, following your specifications:

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to determine whether a given text contains toxic content. Toxicity is defined as any language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or attacked.

The text will be in English and consist of simple sentences, possibly forming a short paragraph.

The label you need to predict is 'toxicity', which is a binary classification:

*   **1:** The text contains toxic content.
*   **0:** The text does not contain toxic content.

Your output should follow the format: `toxicity: [prediction]`

Here's how you should approach the task using chain-of-thought reasoning:

1.  **Read the text carefully and identify any potentially toxic elements.** Look for insults, threats, disrespectful language, or any statements that could be offensive or harmful.
2.  **Consider the context of the text.** Sometimes, words that might seem toxic in isolation are not intended to be harmful within a specific context.
3.  **Evaluate the overall tone and intent of the text.** Is the primary goal to attack, demean, or harm someone, or is it simply expressing a strong opinion or disagreement?
4.  **Based on your analysis, assign the appropriate label (1 or 0) to the 'toxicity' category.**
5.  **Output ONLY the label in the format:** `toxicity: [prediction]`

Here is an example:

Text: ""I think your idea is really stupid, and you should feel bad about suggesting it.""
This text contains a disrespectful and insulting statement. Therefore, toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text and provide your prediction:

Text: 'Considering the real facts of this issue, I believe that it was inappropriate for the informant to report this ""scandal"" to the media. In my opinion, the informant most likely has a personal vendetta with individuals in the school. Or it is a common case of parental gossip.

You are an expert text classifier, skilled at identifying toxic content. Your task is to analyze the provided text and determine whether it contains any form of toxicity, including hate speech, threats, insults, or abusive language. You must first carefully consider the context and intent of the text before making your final classification.

Here's how you should approach the task:

1.  **Careful Reading:** Read the provided text carefully and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments.
2.  **Contextual Analysis:** Analyze the context in which these potentially toxic elements appear. Consider the author's intent and the overall tone of the text. Is the language genuinely meant to be harmful, or is it being used in a satirical or critical way?
3.  **Reasoning:** Explain your reasoning for classifying the text as either toxic or non-toxic. Provide specific examples from the text to support your decision.
4.  **Final Classification:** Based on your analysis, provide a final classification using the format ""toxicity: [ ]"". Insert '1' if the text contains toxicity and '0' if it does not.

Here are some important definitions to guide your classification:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, hurtful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Includes hate speech, threats, insults, and abusive language.')
*   ('Non-Toxicity', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and constructive. Does not contain any elements of hate speech, threats, insults, or abuse.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 for toxic, 0 for non-toxic.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, analyze the following text:

</prompt>"|0.0|"1.  **Careful Reading:** The text contains the phrase ""pretty silly."" This phrase can be considered mildly negative, but it's not inherently toxic. The rest of the text appears to be factual and analytical, discussing an election and claims made about a political figure.
2.  **Contextual Analysis:** The phrase ""pretty silly"" is used to describe a claim made by someone else. The author is expressing their opinion that the claim is weak or unfounded. The tone is critical but not abusive. The overall context is political commentary, and the language used is relatively mild.
3.  **Reasoning:** While the text expresses disagreement and uses the phrase ""pretty silly,"" it doesn't contain any hate speech, threats, insults, or abusive language. The criticism is directed at a specific claim, not at a person's character or identity. The language is not likely to make someone leave a discussion.

Answer: toxicity: [1]
"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for toxicity classification, incorporating the specifications you provided:

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences, part of a larger document (likely a comment or discussion).
**Explanation of the label:**  The label indicates whether the given text contains toxic language, defined as language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone want to leave a discussion.
**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (either toxic or not toxic).
**Language of the text:** English

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. You will be provided with a short text snippet. Your task is to determine whether the text contains any toxic language. Toxic language includes rudeness, disrespect, threats, hate speech, and any language likely to make someone want to leave a discussion.

First, carefully read the text and identify any potentially toxic elements. Consider the context of the words and phrases used.

Then, explain your reasoning step-by-step.

Finally, based on your reasoning, classify the text as either toxic (1) or not toxic (0).

Output your classification in the following format: `toxicity: [classification]`

Here are some examples:

Text: ""This is a stupid idea and you are an idiot for suggesting it.""
Reasoning: The text contains explicitly insulting language (""idiot"") and dismissive language (""stupid idea""). This is clearly toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""I disagree with your assessment, but I respect your right to have your own opinion.""
Reasoning: The text expresses disagreement but does so in a respectful manner. There is no toxic language present.
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""I think we should consider alternative approaches.""
Reasoning: The text suggests a different course of action in a neutral way, without using rude or disrespectful language.
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You're completely wrong, and I can't believe you're so ignorant.""
Reasoning: The text is disrespectful and makes claims about the person's intelligence.
toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: 'On its face, Glueck's claim that AG Rosenblum needed a stronger settlement for her re-election is pretty silly. She currently has no opponent, and the Republicans have not fielded a primary candidate for AG in two election cycles.'
Reasoning: The text uses the phrase ""pretty silly"" which can be dismissive but is not overtly offensive or hateful. Overall, the tone remains professional.
toxicity: [0]
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Reasoning: The text uses the phrase ""pretty silly"" to describe a claim. While potentially dismissive, it does not contain personal attacks, insults, or hateful language. The statement focuses on the claim itself rather than attacking the person who made it. The context suggests a political discussion or debate, where such expressions are common but not necessarily toxic.

"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a Chain-of-Thought prompt that will guide a language model to classify a given text as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). The prompt should also specify the expected output format and mention the language of the text.

Here's the prompt:

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity can include hate speech, threats, insults, or any language intended to offend, demean, or harm an individual or group. The language of the text is English. We will use a step-by-step reasoning approach.

First, carefully read the text and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments.

Second, evaluate the context in which these potentially toxic elements appear. Consider the author's intent and the overall message being conveyed. Does the language promote harm, discrimination, or animosity? Or, is it used in a way that is not harmful or offensive?

Third, based on your analysis, determine whether the text contains toxicity (1) or does not contain toxicity (0).

Finally, provide your answer in the specified format: 'toxicity: []', placing your binary classification (1 or 0) inside the square brackets.

Here is the text to analyze:

'Congratulations on taking this step with Civil Comments. An engaged community of readers can greatly enhance your publication's value.

<\prompt>
"|"Here's my analysis:

First, I read the text and didn't find any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments. The language is positive and supportive.

Second, I considered the context. The text congratulates someone on implementing a comment system and expresses hope that it will foster a positive online community, similar to a letters-to-the-editor section in a print publication. The author seems to be encouraging constructive engagement.

Third, based on this analysis, I conclude that the text does not contain toxicity.

Next, consider the type of classification we are performing:
- ('Label type', 'Binary Classification: The text is either toxic (1) or not toxic (0).')

Consider the language of the text:
- ('Language', 'English')

Now, break down the given text into smaller segments and evaluate each segment for toxicity based on the definition above.  Does the text contain hate speech? Does it contain threats, insults, or disparaging remarks? Is the text rude or disrespectful? Does any part of the text promote violence or discrimination?

After carefully evaluating the text, provide your final classification in the following format: toxicity: [].  Place a '1' inside the brackets if the text is toxic and a '0' if the text is not toxic.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (either toxic or not toxic).

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxicity in text. You will be provided with a text passage and your task is to determine whether the passage contains any toxic content. Toxicity includes hate speech, insults, threats, harassment, offensive language, and any content intended to demean, marginalize, or cause harm to individuals or groups.

First, carefully read the passage and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments.
Second, consider the context of the passage. A word or phrase that might seem toxic in isolation may not be toxic when considered in the context of the surrounding text.
Third, based on your analysis, determine whether the passage as a whole is toxic.
Finally, provide your classification in the format ""toxicity: [ ]"", where you replace the brackets with '1' if the passage is toxic and '0' if it is not.

Here's an example:

Text: ""You are a stupid idiot and nobody likes you.""
This passage contains insults and demeaning language. Therefore, it is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""I disagree with your opinion on this matter.""
This passage simply expresses disagreement and does not contain any toxic content. Therefore, it is not toxic.

Finally, based on your analysis, assign a binary label: '1' if the text contains toxicity, and '0' if it does not. Output ONLY the label, inside the brackets.

Text: 'I don't know that this article is discarding Mrs. Patel. I think it is just stating what Moxie tried to pin on her (which was very disgraceful). If you're still pursuing litigation, report gcandland.com to the authorities/ your lawyers. She's back and trying to scam more innocent people.'.

Let's think step by step. The text mentions ""disgraceful"" which can be negative but is not necessarily toxic on its own. It also accuses someone of ""trying to scam more innocent people,"" which is a serious accusation, and if untrue, could be considered defamatory and potentially toxic. However, the overall tone of the message is not overtly aggressive or hateful. It expresses concern and suggests actions to take. The accusation of scamming is the most significant potential source of toxicity, but without more context or stronger language, it's borderline.

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity.

<prompt>
First, read the following text carefully: ""I don't know that this article is discarding Mrs. Patel. I think it is just stating what Moxie tried to pin on her (which was very disgraceful). If you're still pursuing litigation, report gcandland.com to the authorities/ your lawyers. She's back and trying to scam more innocent people.""

Now, consider the following aspects of the text to determine if it contains toxicity:

1.  **Presence of personal attacks or insults:** Does the text contain language that is intended to offend, demean, or threaten an individual or group?
2.  **Use of hate speech:** Does the text promote violence, discrimination, or prejudice against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristics?
3.  **Threats or incitement to violence:** Does the text contain explicit or implicit threats of harm or violence against individuals or groups?
4.  **Profanity or obscenity:** Does the text contain offensive or vulgar language?
5.  **Targeted harassment:** Does the text target a specific individual or group for abuse or harassment? Consider if it reveals personal information (doxing) or encourages others to engage in harassment.
6. **False Accusations or Scams**: Is someone being falsely accused of something, or being called a scammer.

Based on these considerations, does the text exhibit toxic behavior? Explain your reasoning step by step.

Finally, classify the text as toxic (1) or not toxic (0) based on your analysis. Answer only with: toxicity: [].
</prompt>
"|"Here's an analysis of the text and a toxicity classification:

**Analysis:**

1.  **Presence of personal attacks or insults:** The text uses the phrase ""very disgraceful"" to describe Moxie's actions. It also accuses someone of trying to ""scam more innocent people."" Calling someone a ""scammer"" can be considered a personal attack.
2.  **Use of hate speech:** The text does not contain hate speech.
3.  **Threats or incitement to violence:** The text does not contain explicit threats or incitement to violence, although advising someone to report gcandland.com to ""authorities/your lawyers"" implies potential legal action.
4.  **Profanity or obscenity:** The text does not contain profanity or obscenity.
5.  **Targeted harassment:** The text does not reveal personal information (doxing). It does name a website (gcandland.com) and a person (Mrs. Patel) who is being accused of scamming. The call to report the website could encourage others to engage in harassment, depending on how it is interpreted.
6. **False Accusations or Scams**: The text accuses ""She"" (presumably Mrs. Patel) of ""trying to scam more innocent people."" This is a direct accusation of a scam.

**Conclusion:**

While the text doesn't contain hate speech, profanity, or direct threats of violence, it does contain accusations of disgraceful behavior and scamming, which could be considered personal attacks and potentially incite harassment. Calling someone a ""scammer"" is a derogatory statement and falls into the category of false accusation.

toxicity: []  
</prompt>"|0.0|"Let's analyze the given text step by step to determine if it contains toxicity:

1. **Content Analysis**:
   - The text discusses an article about Mrs. Patel and mentions that Moxie tried to pin something on her, calling it ""very disgraceful."" This is a strong negative judgment but is directed at an action (""what Moxie tried to pin on her"") rather than a personal attack.
   - The phrase ""She's back and trying to scam more innocent people"" is accusatory (""scam"") but is framed as a warning to others rather than a direct insult or hate speech.

2. **Toxicity Indicators**:
   - The language includes strong negative terms like ""disgraceful"" and ""scam,"" but these are used to describe actions or behaviors, not to directly insult or demean a person.
   - There are no explicit insults, threats, or hate speech directed at an individual or group.

3. **Context**:
   - The tone is critical and accusatory, but it appears to be part of a dispute or disagreement (e.g., ""pursuing litigation""). While the language is harsh, it does not clearly cross into toxicity as defined (harmful, offensive, or disrespectful language).

4. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Unlike the toxic examples (e.g., ""You're an idiot,"" ""Go jump off a cliff""), this text does not contain direct personal attacks or violent language.

### Conclusion:
The text is critical and accusatory but does not meet the threshold for toxicity as defined. The strong language is directed at actions or behaviors, not individuals, and there are no explicit insults or threats.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach, considering various aspects of the text, and then provide a final classification based on our reasoning.

**Text:** 'I don't know that this article is discarding Mrs. Patel. I think it is just stating what Moxie tried to pin on her (which was very disgraceful). If you're still pursuing litigation, report gcandland.com to the authorities/ your lawyers. She's back and trying to scam more innocent people.'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Contains hate speech, aggressive tones, insults or threats.')
*   ('Non-Toxicity', 'Language that is respectful, neutral, and does not contain any harmful or offensive elements.')

('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 for toxic, 0 for non-toxic')
('Language', 'English')

Now, let's examine the text closely:

1.  **Identify potential offensive language:** Does the text contain direct insults, slurs, or hate speech targeting any individual or group?
2.  **Analyze the tone and intent:** Is the overall tone of the text aggressive, disrespectful, or threatening? Is the intent to harm, demean, or incite hatred?
3.  **Examine specific phrases:** Are there any specific phrases or sentences that could be considered toxic based on our definition? Does the text make accusations that could harm a person's reputation?
4.  **Consider the context:** How might a reasonable person interpret this text? Could it be perceived as offensive or harmful by the target or others?

Based on the above analysis, does the text contain toxic content? Provide a brief explanation of your reasoning, considering the factors above, and then assign a label.

Reasoning: The text includes phrases like ""very disgraceful"" and accusations of ""trying to scam more innocent people."" While not overtly hateful, the accusations and the potential to incite negative actions against the mentioned website (gcandland.com) lean towards toxicity. The accusation of scamming is a serious allegation and can be harmful.

Therefore, the classification is:

The text is in English, written in simple sentences.

The label is ""toxicity"".

The label type is binary:
*   1: The text contains toxicity.
*   0: The text does not contain toxicity.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a wonderful and helpful comment.""
First, let's analyze the text. The text expresses positive sentiment and appreciation. It does not contain any offensive or disrespectful language. Therefore, the text does not contain toxicity.
toxicity: [0]

Here's another example:

Text: ""You are a stupid idiot and your idea is terrible.""
First, let's analyze the text. The text contains insulting and demeaning language. The phrases ""stupid idiot"" and ""your idea is terrible"" are disrespectful and likely to make someone feel unwelcome. Therefore, the text contains toxicity.
toxicity: [1]

First, let's analyze the text. The text contains the phrase ""very disgraceful"" which can be considered negative but is not directed at a specific person with insulting intent. The text also suggests reporting a website for ""trying to scam more innocent people,"" which is an accusation of malicious behavior. While the text expresses negative opinions and accusations, it lacks overtly rude or hateful language directly targeted at individuals. The phrase ""trying to scam more innocent people"" is a strong accusation, but in the context, it's a statement about the website's alleged actions rather than a direct personal attack. Therefore, the text contains toxicity.
toxicity: []

"|"Okay, I can create a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying text toxicity with a binary output (1 or 0).

<prompt>
First, read the following text carefully and identify any potentially offensive, disrespectful, or harmful content. Consider elements like hate speech, insults, threats, profanity, discrimination, or disparagement targeting individuals or groups. Evaluate the overall tone and intent of the text. Does the text promote violence, incite hatred, or target vulnerable groups? Based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity. If the text contains any of these elements, classify it as toxic. Otherwise, classify it as non-toxic.

Text: 'Yet call out all Muslims for the acts of a few will get you pilloried.   So why is it okay to smear an entire religion over these few idiots?  Or is this because it's okay to bash Christian sects?'.

Now, provide your final classification using the following format: toxicity: []. Insert either 1 (toxic) or 0 (non-toxic) inside the square brackets based on your reasoning above.
<\prompt>
"|"The text questions the selective application of criticism towards different religious groups. It points out the hypocrisy in condemning an entire religion based on the actions of a few individuals, while simultaneously questioning the acceptability of disparaging Christian sects. While the language used is somewhat charged (""smear,"" ""idiots,"" ""bash""), the core argument revolves around fairness and consistency in criticizing religious groups. The text does not promote violence, incite hatred, or directly target any vulnerable groups with insults or threats. The tone is critical and questioning, rather than overtly hateful.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to break down the text and identify any potentially toxic elements.

Here's the text: 'Yet call out all Muslims for the acts of a few will get you pilloried.   So why is it okay to smear an entire religion over these few idiots?  Or is this because it's okay to bash Christian sects?'

First, consider the following definitions:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone want to leave a discussion. Includes hate speech, aggressive language, and personal attacks.')
*   ('Non-Toxicity', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and contributes positively to a discussion.')

Now, consider the type of label:

*   ('Label Type', 'Binary classification: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.')

Also, consider the language:

*   ('Language', 'English')

Let's break down the text:

1.  **Identify potential targets:** Are any individuals or groups being targeted or negatively portrayed?
2.  **Analyze the sentiment:** Is the overall tone negative, aggressive, or disrespectful?
3.  **Look for specific toxic keywords or phrases:** Are there any slurs, insults, or threats?
4.  **Assess the intent:** Is the author trying to attack, demean, or provoke a negative reaction?

Based on your analysis of the text, does it contain any of the elements described in the 'Toxicity' definition? Explain your reasoning.

Finally, provide your classification in the following format:

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|1.0|"Here's an analysis of the text and the final classification:

**Analysis:**

1.  **Potential Targets:** The text targets two religious groups: Muslims and Christians (specifically Christian sects). While it criticizes the act of ""calling out all Muslims for the acts of a few,"" it also questions if it's ""okay to smear an entire religion"" and ""okay to bash Christian sects.""

2.  **Sentiment:** The overall tone is questioning and slightly accusatory. It expresses frustration with what the author perceives as a double standard in how different religious groups are treated. The words ""smear"" and ""bash"" carry negative connotations.

3.  **Toxic Keywords or Phrases:** While there are no outright slurs, the phrases ""smear an entire religion"" and ""bash Christian sects"" indicate a potentially harmful generalization and negativity towards those groups. The term ""these few idiots"" is disrespectful, although it is used to refer to a small subset of a larger group, and the author is questioning if that small group should impact the overall perception of the larger group.

4.  **Intent:** The intent appears to be to challenge a perceived double standard and highlight potential bias in how religious groups are discussed. While the core argument might have a valid point, the language used could be seen as provocative and potentially harmful due to the generalizations and negative framing. Questioning whether something is ""okay to smear"" or ""okay to bash"" implies that such actions may be occurring, and this can contribute to a hostile environment.

**Reasoning:**

The text is problematic because it uses potentially inflammatory language when discussing religious groups. While it seems to argue *against* generalizations, the very act of questioning whether it's ""okay to smear"" a religion, even rhetorically, contributes to a potentially toxic discussion. The use of words like ""smear"" and ""bash,"" along with the accusation of double standards, creates a negative and confrontational tone. Therefore, while the text isn't overtly hateful, it does contain elements of disrespect and the potential to provoke a negative reaction, pushing it into the toxic category.

**Classification:**

Let's analyze the provided text for toxicity. We will use a chain-of-thought approach, considering various factors to determine if the text contains any elements that could be considered toxic, such as hate speech, threats, insults, or offensive language.

First, let's define our labels:

- ('Toxicity', 'Presence of offensive, hateful, or otherwise harmful language in the text.')
- ('Not Toxicity', 'Absence of offensive, hateful, or otherwise harmful language in the text.')

Now, consider the label type:

- ('Label type', 'Binary classification')
- ('Binary', 'Either the text contains toxicity (1) or it does not (0).')

Also the language of the text:

- ('Language', 'English')

Given the text: 'Seven minutes? Time to go to the coffee shop next door then.'

Is there any indication of hate speech, threats, insults, or offensive language in the text? Does the text promote violence, discrimination, or any form of harm? Is the sentence disrespectful, rude, or demeaning towards any individual or group? After carefully examining the text, determine if it exhibits any characteristics of toxicity. What is your final answer?

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates the presence or absence of toxic content within the given text. Toxic content encompasses language that is offensive, hateful, abusive, or disrespectful.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1).

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
Let's think step by step. We need to classify if a given text contains toxicity. Toxicity includes offensive language, hate speech, abusive words, disrespect, and generally any content that could be harmful or offensive to others.

First, read the text carefully.
Second, analyze the text for any signs of toxicity as defined above. Look for insults, threats, prejudiced language, or aggressive tone.
Third, if the text contains any of these signs, classify it as toxic (1). If the text is neutral and does not contain any toxic elements, classify it as non-toxic (0).

Here's an example:
Text: 'You are a moron and nobody likes you.'
This text contains insults and offensive language. Therefore, toxicity: [1]

Here's another example:
Text: 'I disagree with your opinion, but I respect your right to have it.'
This text is respectful and does not contain any toxic elements. Therefore, toxicity: [0]

Now, classify the following text:
Text: 'Seven minutes? Time to go to the coffee shop next door then.'

"|0.0|"The text 'Seven minutes? Time to go to the coffee shop next door then.' does not contain any offensive language, hate speech, abusive words, disrespect, or any content that could be harmful or offensive. It's a neutral statement expressing a decision to pass time elsewhere.

Therefore, toxicity: [0]

*   **0:** Indicates the absence of toxic language in the text. The text is considered neutral or non-offensive.

**Language of the Text:** English

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic language. We need to consider if the language used is hateful, disrespectful, offensive, or harmful in any way.

Text: ""Why would we need independently wealthy candidates? wheeler isnt self-funding, he's just taking checks by the $ tens of thousands. Bailey is taking a maximum of $250 from each donor.""

First, let's break down the text. The text expresses an opinion about campaign finance and the sources of funding for political candidates. It questions the need for independently wealthy candidates and contrasts two candidates' fundraising strategies. The language used is critical and potentially sarcastic (""just taking checks by the $ tens of thousands""), but it doesn't directly attack any individual with insults, threats, or derogatory terms. While the statement could be interpreted as negative commentary, it lacks explicit expressions of hate, disrespect, or harm.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the text does not contain toxic language.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step approach to identify potentially harmful language, and then provide a final classification based on our findings.

Here's the text:

'Why would we need independently wealthy candidates?  wheeler isnt self-funding, he's just taking checks by the $ tens of thousands.  Bailey is taking a maximum of $250 from each donor.'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, hurtful, or likely to make someone feel upset or threatened. This includes insults, name-calling, threats, and hate speech.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification (0 or 1)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's examine the text for potentially toxic elements:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** Are there any insults, slurs, or derogatory terms used?
2.  **Assess the tone and intent:** Is the overall tone aggressive, dismissive, or disrespectful? Is the author trying to attack or belittle someone?
3.  **Consider the context:** Could the language be interpreted as harmful or offensive, even if it's not explicitly toxic? Does it promote hate or discrimination?

Based on the above analysis, does the text contain any toxic elements? Explain your reasoning.

*   The intent seems to be to highlight a perceived difference in funding models between the candidates. While critical, it doesn't appear to be driven by hate or malice.

**Step 3: Consider the context:**

*   The context is political commentary. In political discourse, criticisms of candidates and their funding are common.
*   The language, while direct, doesn't cross the line into personal attacks or hate speech. It focuses on the candidates' financial practices.

**Reasoning:**

While the text expresses a critical opinion about the candidates' fundraising, it doesn't use abusive language, target protected groups, or promote harm. It's within the bounds of acceptable political commentary, even if somewhat pointed.

**Toxicity Classification:**

**Few-shot Prompt for Toxicity Detection**

This prompt is designed to classify English text as either containing toxicity (1) or not containing toxicity (0). The classification is binary (either toxic or not toxic). The text consists of simple sentences, typically found in online comments or discussions.

*   **Label Definition:**
    *   `1`: The text contains toxic language, including insults, threats, hate speech, or aggressive and disrespectful statements.
    *   `0`: The text does not contain toxic language. It is neutral, informative, or expresses opinions in a respectful manner.

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, following your specifications:

**Definition of the task:**

The task is to classify whether a given text contains toxicity or not.

**Format of the text:**

The text consists of simple sentences, potentially extracted from online discussions or comments.

**Explanation of the label:**

The label represents the presence or absence of toxic content within the text. Toxicity encompasses rude, disrespectful, or offensive language, hate speech, threats, or any content intended to harm, insult, or provoke.

**Definition of the type of the label:**

The label is binary:
*   1: The text contains toxicity.
*   0: The text does not contain toxicity.

**Language of the text:**

The language of the text is English.

<prompt>
Here's how we will approach this task. We will analyze the text provided step-by-step to determine if it contains any toxic elements. We will consider the presence of hate speech, insults, threats, profanity, and disrespectful language. If the text contains such elements, we will classify it as toxic (1). Otherwise, if the text is neutral and doesn't contain harmful content, we will classify it as non-toxic (0).

Now, let's apply this to the following example:

Text: 'Why would we need independently wealthy candidates? wheeler isnt self-funding, he's just taking checks by the $ tens of thousands. Bailey is taking a maximum of $250 from each donor.'

First, analyze the text for explicit hate speech. There is no hate speech.
Second, check for insults and abusive language. There are no insults or abusive language.
Third, see if there are any threats. There are no threats.
Fourth, is there profanity? There is no profanity.
Finally, is the language disrespectful or rude? The language is neutral.

Based on this analysis, does the text contain toxicity? No.

Therefore, the classification is:

toxicity: [0]
<\prompt>
"|0.0|"That's a good, structured approach to analyzing text for toxicity. Your analysis of the example text is accurate.  Based on your criteria and the absence of hate speech, insults, threats, profanity, or disrespectful language, the classification of non-toxic ([0]) is correct.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or otherwise offensive language that could cause someone to feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome. Consider elements like insults, threats, hate speech, disparagement, and prejudice. The language of the text is English.

Text: 'Is there evidence that it was a Bernie supporter? Last time I checked, Trump supporters poop too.'

First, break down the text into its component parts. The first sentence questions the affiliation of someone with Bernie Sanders. The second sentence makes a general statement about Trump supporters.

Next, evaluate whether each part contains any toxic elements based on our definition. The first sentence could be interpreted as subtly implying a negative association with Bernie supporters, but it's not directly offensive. The second sentence is a general, albeit somewhat crude, statement and doesn't directly insult or threaten anyone.

Finally, consider the overall tone and impact of the text. While the text is not particularly polite or refined, it doesn't rise to the level of toxicity as defined above. It lacks explicit insults, threats, or hate speech.

Therefore, does the text contain toxicity? Answer with either 1 for toxicity or 0 for non-toxicity.

Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwise.

Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a step-by-step reasoning process to determine if the text contains toxic elements.

**Text:** 'Is there evidence that it was a Bernie supporter? Last time I checked, Trump supporters poop too.'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or offended. It includes personal attacks, name-calling, and generalizations that target specific groups of people.')
- ('Label type', 'Binary (1 for toxic, 0 for non-toxic)')
- ('Language', 'English')

Now, break down the text and identify potentially toxic elements:

1.  **Identify potential targets:** The text mentions ""Bernie supporter"" and ""Trump supporters."" These could be potential targets of toxic language if the text stereotypes, insults, or makes derogatory statements about them.
2.  **Analyze for insults or attacks:** The statement ""Trump supporters poop too"" is a generalization. While it doesn't seem overtly offensive, it could be interpreted as dismissive or sarcastic, potentially contributing to a hostile tone. It also implies a comparison, suggesting that being a Trump supporter is somehow negative or unusual. It also implicitly refers to ""Bernie supporters""
3.  **Consider the overall intent and context:** The intent seems to be dismissive, minimizing the importance of the person's political affiliation, but it is not an overtly offensive or threatening statment.
4.  **Make a toxicity determination:** Based on the analysis above, decide if the text is toxic or not. Consider also the context of the phrase, if this phrase is inside a threating conversation, the meaning and the toxicity level can change.

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences, conversational in nature.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the provided text contains toxic content. Toxicity can include hate speech, offensive language, insults, threats, or any content intended to demean or harm an individual or group.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1). 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>

**Task:** You are an expert in identifying toxic content in text. You will be given a sentence and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic elements such as hate speech, offensive language, insults, threats, or any content intended to demean or harm an individual or group. You must provide your reasoning step-by-step, and then provide your final answer in the format ""toxicity: [ ]"", where the square brackets contain either ""1"" (if toxic) or ""0"" (if not toxic).

**Example 1:**

Text: ""This is a harmless and polite statement.""
Reasoning: The sentence expresses no offensive or harmful content. There is no indication of hate speech, insults, or threats. The statement appears to be innocuous.
toxicity: [0]

**Example 2:**

Text: ""You are a stupid idiot and I hate you.""
Reasoning: The sentence contains direct insults (""stupid idiot"") and expresses hatred. This clearly indicates toxic content.
toxicity: [1]

**Example 3:**

Text: ""While I disagree with your opinion, I respect your right to have it.""
Reasoning: The sentence expresses disagreement but does so respectfully. There is no offensive language or intention to harm.
toxicity: [0]

**Example 4:**

Text: ""We should eliminate all members of that group.""
Reasoning: This sentence promotes violence and expresses hatred toward a specific group. This is considered hate speech and thus is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

**Now, analyze the following text:**

Text: ""Is there evidence that it was a Bernie supporter? Last time I checked, Trump supporters poop too.""
Reasoning: The sentence attempts to subtly demean Trump supporters by suggesting a common negative trait. While not overtly hateful, it employs a dismissive and mildly offensive comparison. The second part of the sentence isn't explicitly hateful, but the implication contributes to a negative portrayal.
toxicity: [1]

</prompt>
"|1.0|"Reasoning: The statement makes a comparison between Trump supporters and a negative action (""poop too""). While seemingly innocuous, it implies that Trump supporters are somehow similar in engaging in this action. This can be interpreted as subtly offensive and demeaning towards a group.

Here's the prompt:

```
 <prompt>
 You are an expert in identifying toxic language in online text. You will be given a text excerpt and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic elements.

 First, consider the definition of toxicity: Toxicity encompasses language that is rude, disrespectful, dismissive, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion. It includes personal attacks, insults, threats, and hate speech, but also subtle forms of negativity, such as belittling opinions or condescending tones.

 Analyze the text step-by-step, considering these questions:

 1. Does the text contain any personal attacks or insults directed at individuals or groups?
 2. Does the text express hatred or prejudice towards any particular group based on their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other characteristic?
 3. Does the text use offensive language, slurs, or epithets?
 4. Does the text make threats of violence or harm?
 5. Does the text employ a dismissive, condescending, or belittling tone towards any individual or group?
 6. Does the text contain any language that is likely to offend, alienate, or upset other users?
 7. Language of the text is English.

 Based on your analysis, provide a justification for your classification, summarizing which of the above criteria are met (if any). Then, state your final classification using the following format: 'toxicity: [classification]', where classification is either 1 (if toxic) or 0 (if non-toxic).

 ```"|"Let's analyze the text for toxic elements:

1. **Personal attacks or insults:** The text doesn't directly attack any individual or group.
2. **Hatred or prejudice:** There's no expression of hatred or prejudice against any protected group.
3. **Offensive language:** The text doesn't contain any offensive slurs or epithets.
4. **Threats of violence:** There are no threats of violence or harm.
5. **Dismissive tone:** The phrase ""Grow.. or.."" could be interpreted as slightly condescending, implying a negative outcome for Portland if it doesn't grow. However, this is mild.
6. **Offensive/alienating language:** The comparison to Detroit, while not inherently hateful, could be seen as negative and potentially offensive to people from Detroit, as it implies a decline or undesirable state. However, it is not directed at any group or individuals specifically.
7. **Language:** The language is English.

Overall, the text doesn't contain overt toxicity. The comparison to Detroit and the ""Grow.. or.."" statement are the closest things to negativity, but they don't rise to the level of personal attacks, hate speech, or direct threats.

First, analyze the text provided for indicators of toxicity, such as hateful language, insults, threats, offensive terms, disparagement, or disrespectful comments targeting individuals or groups. Consider the overall tone and intent of the message. Does the language promote violence, discrimination, or prejudice? Is there any content that could be perceived as malicious, aggressive, or abusive? Then, based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity. If it does, classify it as 1. If the text is neutral, harmless, or non-offensive, classify it as 0.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step approach to break down the text and identify potential indicators of toxicity.

Here's the text:

""More people move to CA from Portland; than people moving from CA to Portland. Just the facts. A lot more people. Sun. Jobs. Opportunity. It will always have a bigger draw. Always has. But.. YES.. Portland is getting exposed, moving forward, growing up, densifying.. be glad.. it could be another Detroit. Grow.. or..""

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context.

*   ('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or otherwise offensive language, hate speech, threats, insults, or content aimed at harming or demeaning individuals or groups.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 if it does not.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's break down the text into smaller parts and analyze each for toxicity:

1.  ""More people move to CA from Portland; than people moving from CA to Portland. Just the facts. A lot more people. Sun. Jobs. Opportunity. It will always have a bigger draw. Always has."" - This part seems factual and descriptive, comparing migration patterns between California and Portland. There are no obvious signs of toxicity here.

2.  ""But.. YES.. Portland is getting exposed, moving forward, growing up, densifying.. be glad.. it could be another Detroit."" - This part implies a negative comparison of Portland to Detroit. While not explicitly hateful, the phrase ""it could be another Detroit"" could be interpreted as demeaning, depending on the context and perception of Detroit.

3.  ""Grow.. or.."" - This part is incomplete but could imply a negative consequence if growth doesn't occur. However, it's too vague to determine toxicity.

Considering the analysis above, does the text contain toxic elements? Focus on the potential negative comparison and make a judgment.

Based on your analysis, provide your final answer in the following format:

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|1.0|"The text contains a subtle form of toxicity. The comparison of Portland to Detroit is a potential negative comparison. While not overtly hateful, it implies that becoming like Detroit would be undesirable, which can be seen as demeaning towards Detroit and its residents. This falls under the category of ""offensive language aimed at harming or demeaning individuals or groups,"" even if indirectly.

I have suspected he may be a little thin-skinned since he banished me from his Facebook page, because I commented against fluoridation of Portland's water, but hey, maybe he was just having a bad day.""

1. **Tone and Language**: The tone is neutral to slightly critical but not aggressive or offensive. The speaker expresses uncertainty (""I have not heard..."", ""I do not know..."") and shares a personal experience without using harsh language.
2. **Potential Criticism**: The phrase ""a little thin-skinned"" could be mildly critical, but it is not insulting or demeaning. It is a subjective observation framed in a non-hostile way (""maybe he was just having a bad day"" softens the remark).
3. **No Harmful Elements**: There are no insults, threats, or disrespectful remarks. The speaker even acknowledges the possibility of misunderstanding (""maybe he was just having a bad day"").

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step approach to identify potentially harmful elements and arrive at a final classification.

**Text:** 'I have not heard Wolfson's show on XRAY, so I do not know about the recent controversy.  He seemed a nice fellow when I met him four few years at a fundraiser.  I have suspected he may be a little thin-skinned since he banished me from his Facebook page, because I commented against fluoridation of Portland's water, but hey, maybe he was just having a bad day.'

Here's our thought process:

1.  **Identify potential indicators of toxicity:** Look for words or phrases that express hate, aggression, insults, threats, or discrimination. Also, consider if the text targets any individual or group in a negative way.
2.  **Assess the severity of the language:** Is the language used overtly offensive, or is it more subtle? Does the text promote harm or violence?
3.  **Evaluate the context:** Consider the overall context of the text. Is it part of a larger discussion where strong opinions are expected? Is it meant to be satirical or humorous? Could the language be interpreted differently depending on the audience?
4.  **Synthesize the information:** Based on the previous steps, determine if the text, on balance, contains toxic content. If the text contains hateful or offensive content, targetted at a group or individual, it is probably toxic.

Based on the text and our analysis above, does it contain toxicity?

1.  Carefully read the text provided.
2.  Identify any words, phrases, or statements that could be interpreted as offensive, insulting, threatening, or hateful.
3.  Consider the overall context of the text. Does the language target any individual or group in a negative way? Does it promote violence or discrimination?
4.  Based on your analysis, determine if the text exhibits toxic behavior.
5.  If the text contains toxic elements, classify it as '1'. If it does not, classify it as '0'.

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity:

<prompt>
First, carefully read the following text: ""Their ridiculous band photo has me wanting to drink white wine at 3 in the afternoon. It's almost 5, right?"".

Now, consider whether this text contains any language that is hateful, disrespectful, offensive, or discriminatory towards any individual or group. Break down your reasoning step-by-step.

*   **Step 1: Identify potential targets.** Does the text target any specific person or group?
*   **Step 2: Assess sentiment.** Is the sentiment expressed in the text generally negative or positive? Is there any use of sarcasm or mockery?
*   **Step 3: Evaluate for toxicity.** Based on your analysis of targets and sentiment, does the text contain any elements of hate speech, insults, threats, or other forms of toxic language?

Finally, based on your reasoning, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

Therefore, toxicity: []
<\prompt>
"|"Here's a breakdown of the text's potential toxicity:

*   **Step 1: Identify potential targets.** The text mentions a ""ridiculous band photo."" The implicit target is the band whose photo is being discussed. It also alludes to drinking white wine, which could be interpreted as a slight jab at people who enjoy that beverage.
*   **Step 2: Assess sentiment.** The sentiment is generally negative towards the band photo, using the word ""ridiculous,"" which implies mockery. The white wine comment seems like a sarcastic reaction to the photo, possibly suggesting that the photo is so bad that it makes the speaker want to engage in an activity that is associated with a certain type of relaxation or escape.
*   **Step 3: Evaluate for toxicity.** The word ""ridiculous"" is mildly negative but not inherently toxic. The reference to drinking white wine is not toxic at all. The text doesn't contain hate speech, insults, threats, or language that targets any protected group. The criticism is directed at the band's photo, not the band members themselves (although it could be inferred that the speaker doesn't like the band members).

Therefore, toxicity: [0]

toxicity: [1]"|0.0|"To determine whether the given text contains toxicity, let's analyze it based on the provided label definitions.

### Analysis:
1. **Content:** The text makes a sarcastic comment about a ""ridiculous band photo"" and humorously suggests wanting to drink white wine at an unconventional time (3 in the afternoon). The tone is lighthearted and mocking but not overtly harmful or offensive.
2. **Intent:** The intent appears to be humorous or teasing rather than malicious or insulting. There is no direct attack on individuals or groups, nor is there explicit harmful language.
3. **Potential Interpretation:** While the word ""ridiculous"" could be seen as mildly negative, it is not strong enough to classify the text as toxic under the given definition. The overall tone is more playful than offensive.

### Conclusion:
The text does not meet the threshold for toxicity (label 1) as it lacks harmful, offensive, or upsetting language. It is best classified as non-toxic.

### Output:
toxicity: [0]"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, incorporating the requested elements:

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a binary classification approach.

Here's the breakdown of our labels:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Presence of offensive, harmful, or malicious language, including insults, threats, hate speech, or abusive content directed at individuals or groups.')
*   ('Non-toxic', 'Absence of offensive, harmful, or malicious language. The text is generally polite, respectful, and does not contain personal attacks or derogatory remarks.')

Label Definition:

*   ('1', 'The text contains toxicity.')
*   ('0', 'The text does not contain toxicity.')

Label Type:

*   ('Binary', 'Classification into one of two mutually exclusive categories: toxic or non-toxic.')

Language:

*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's apply this to the given text. Think step by step, considering potential indicators of toxicity such as insults, threats, or hate speech.

Text: 'Their ridiculous band photo has me wanting to drink white wine at 3 in the afternoon.
It's almost 5, right?'.

First, does the text contain any direct insults or personal attacks? Does it target any individual or group with derogatory language? Is there any use of hate speech? Does the text express any threats or malicious intent? Based on this analysis, does the text lean towards being toxic or non-toxic?

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify the toxicity of a given text, formatted as requested.

<prompt>
First, carefully read the provided text. Then, break down the text into smaller segments or sentences. For each segment, analyze whether it contains any language that is hateful, disrespectful, offensive, abusive, bullying, or threatening. Consider the context of the text and the potential impact of the words on individuals or groups. Determine if the overall tone and sentiment of the text is toxic. A toxic text may include personal attacks, insults, disparaging remarks, or language that promotes discrimination or violence. If, based on your analysis, the text exhibits any of these toxic characteristics, classify it as toxic. If the text does not contain any such elements, classify it as non-toxic. Finally, provide your answer in the format 'toxicity: [ ]', replacing the square brackets with '1' if the text is toxic and '0' if it is not.

Text: 'I don't believe they have any obligation to discuss another student's discipline or school record with other parents. In fact, I believe, they could actually be sued for doing so. The students and families have a right to privacy.

Each of these segments expresses an opinion or belief regarding student privacy and school discipline. The language used is neutral and does not contain any hateful, disrespectful, offensive, abusive, bullying, or threatening content. The tone is reasonable and expresses trust in the school. There are no personal attacks, insults, disparaging remarks, or language that promotes discrimination or violence.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step approach to evaluate the text and arrive at a reasoned conclusion.

First, consider the definitions:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel offended or threatened. This can include insults, name-calling, threats, and hate speech.')
- ('Non-toxic', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and does not contain any offensive or threatening elements.')

Now, let's define the label types:
- ('Label type', 'Binary classification')
- ('Positive label (1)', 'Text contains toxicity')
- ('Negative label (0)', 'Text does not contain toxicity')

Consider the language of the text:
- ('Language', 'English')

Here's the text to analyze:
'I don't believe they have any obligation to discuss another student's discipline or school record with other parents. In fact, I believe, they could actually be sued for doing so. The students and families have a right to privacy. 
I trust the school completely to make the best choice regarding discipline otherwise I would not send my child there.'

Step 1: Carefully read the text and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments.
Step 2: Assess whether the identified elements meet the definition of toxicity provided above. Consider the context in which these elements appear.
Step 3: Determine if the overall tone and message of the text are rude, disrespectful, offensive, or threatening.
Step 4: Based on your analysis, assign a toxicity label (1 for toxic, 0 for non-toxic).

Therefore, the final answer should be formatted as: 'toxicity: []', with the appropriate label (0 or 1) in the square brackets.

Step 2: The text uses phrases like ""obligation,"" ""sued,"" ""right to privacy,"" and ""trust the school completely."" These are not inherently toxic. They are related to legal and ethical considerations and the writer's trust in the school.

Step 3: The overall tone is reasoned and supportive of the school. There is no rudeness, disrespect, offense, or threat present. The argument is presented in a calm and logical manner.

Step 4: Based on this analysis, the text does not contain toxic content.

You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. I will provide you with a text excerpt, and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic content.

First, carefully read and analyze the text to identify any instances of hate speech, offensive language, threats, insults, or language that could be considered harmful or demeaning to individuals or groups.

Then, explain your reasoning step-by-step. Consider the context of the text and the potential impact of the language used.

Finally, based on your analysis, provide a binary classification indicating the presence or absence of toxicity. Assign a value of '1' if the text contains toxicity and '0' if it does not.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a wonderful day!""
Reasoning: The text expresses positive sentiment and contains no offensive or harmful language.
Classification: toxicity: [0]

Text: ""I hate all people from X country.""
Reasoning: The text contains hate speech directed towards a specific group of people based on their nationality. This is considered toxic language.
Classification: toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text and provide your reasoning and classification:

Text: 'I don't believe they have any obligation to discuss another student's discipline or school record with other parents. In fact, I believe, they could actually be sued for doing so. The students and families have a right to privacy.

You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. Toxicity includes hate speech, threats, insults, and generally disrespectful or offensive language. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine whether it contains toxic elements.

First, carefully read and understand the provided text. Then, identify any sentences or phrases that could be considered offensive, disrespectful, or harmful. Consider the overall tone and intent of the text. Ask yourself: Does this text promote hatred, incite violence, or demean any individual or group?

Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). Return your answer in the format ""toxicity: [classification]"".

The language of the text is English.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a friendly and helpful message.""
Reasoning: This text expresses a positive sentiment and contains no offensive language.
Therefore, the classification is non-toxic.

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|"Here's an analysis of the provided text:

*   **Potentially Offensive/Disrespectful Statements:** The phrases ""lied to us from the beginning,"" ""What a pile of lies,"" and ""you are liars"" are accusatory and could be perceived as disrespectful. Calling someone a liar is generally considered an insult. The phrase ""Makes me sick that my money is paying for the captivity and forced breeding of these wild animals"" expresses strong disapproval and could be seen as emotionally charged.

*   **Overall Tone and Intent:** The tone is clearly angry and accusatory. The author feels betrayed by ""Metro"" and believes their money is being misused. The primary intent seems to be to express outrage and demand accountability (a refund). While the language is strong, the argument is about the misuse of funds and the treatment of animals.

*   **Classification:** The text expresses strong negative sentiment and uses accusatory language. However, it doesn't directly attack individuals with insults based on identity or promote violence. It primarily expresses dissatisfaction with a specific entity (""Metro"") and its actions. Therefore, while it has toxic elements, it doesn't reach the level of hate speech or targeted harassment that would typically warrant a full toxicity classification.

2.  **Assess the intent and impact:** Determine if these phrases are used in a way that is intended to harm or offend.  The phrases are directly accusatory and express strong negative sentiment toward ""Metro.""

3.  **Consider the context:**  While criticism is acceptable, the intensity and directness of the accusations suggest a hostile tone.

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to determine whether a given text contains toxic content. Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or otherwise negatively impactful language. The text is in English and consists of simple sentences. The label is binary: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.

Here's how you should approach the task:

1.  **Analyze the text:** Carefully read the text and identify any words, phrases, or sentiments that could be considered rude, disrespectful, offensive, or hateful. Consider the overall tone and intent of the message.
2.  **Evaluate for toxicity:** Based on your analysis, determine whether the text meets the criteria for toxicity. Consider elements such as insults, threats, name-calling, or any language that could be harmful or offensive to others.
3.  **Provide a label:** Assign a binary label based on your evaluation:
    *   Assign '1' if you detect toxicity in the text.
    *   Assign '0' if you do not detect toxicity in the text.

Here's an example to guide you:

**Text:** ""This is a wonderful product. I am very happy with my purchase.""
**Reasoning:** The text expresses positive sentiment and contains no rude or offensive language.
**Answer:** toxicity: [0]

Now, apply the same reasoning and labeling process to the following text:

**Text:** 'Metro has lied to us from the beginning about what this money would really fund. What a pile of lies. Makes me sick that my money is paying for the captivity and forced breeding of these wild animals. I want a refund Metro - you are liars!'.

"|1.0|"Reasoning: The text contains strong accusations of dishonesty (""lied,"" ""pile of lies,"" ""liars""). While the user is expressing frustration and anger, the language used is accusatory and borderline aggressive. The phrase ""makes me sick"" indicates strong negative emotion.

"|"toxicity: [0]
"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a Chain-of-Thought prompt that will guide a language model to classify a given text as toxic or non-toxic, based on its content. The prompt should also specify the language of the input text and clearly define what ""toxicity"" refers to in this context. The prompt should also ask the LLM to output in a specific format.

Here's the prompt:

```
 <prompt>
 Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity.

 First, let's define toxicity in this context. Toxicity refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or offended. It includes hate speech, aggressive language, and any content that promotes violence or discrimination.

 The text is in English.

 Now, read the text carefully and consider whether it contains any elements of toxicity as defined above.

 Text: 'Ryan Bundy seems like a nice, responsible  human being who has been sold a bill of goods by his  intellectually domineering brother, who he idolizes. Ammon has a bunch of other similarly situated nutters following him as well.  Where? No one quite knows. And, unless you live in Burns no one cares. Personally, I am glad these bearded, cammo wearing, narrowly educated , nuisances....are there and not here. Traffic is bad enough.  No reason to make it worse with a Constitutional Pagent Play in the Federal Building in downtown PDX.  And,  repulsive as their  cammo costumes are ( all available at Cabela's and Andy and Bax) with their brandishing weapons it's a very immature male form of exhibitionism....cowboys and indians for middle aged men.'.

 Does the text contain toxic elements according to the definition? Explain your reasoning step by step. Does the text contain hate speech? Does the text contain insults or disparaging remarks? Does the text promote violence? Finally, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

 Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.
 <\prompt>
```"|"Here's a step-by-step analysis:

*   **Rude/Disrespectful Language:** The text uses terms like ""nutters,"" ""nuisances,"" and ""repulsive."" These terms are disrespectful and dismissive.
*   **Insults/Disparaging Remarks:** The text makes several disparaging remarks about the individuals' intelligence (""narrowly educated""), appearance (""bearded, cammo wearing,"" ""repulsive as their cammo costumes""), and behavior (""immature male form of exhibitionism...cowboys and indians for middle aged men""). The phrase ""sold a bill of goods"" implies Ryan Bundy is gullible. The description of Ammon's followers as ""similarly situated nutters"" is also insulting.
*   **Hate Speech:** The text doesn't target any protected group based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. Therefore, it doesn't qualify as hate speech.
*   **Promotion of Violence:** The text does not explicitly promote or incite violence.
*   **Overall Assessment:** While not hate speech or promoting violence, the text contains rude, disrespectful, and insulting language, meeting the definition of toxicity.

<prompt>
First, read the following text carefully. Then, break down the text into smaller segments and analyze each segment for potentially toxic language, including hate speech, insults, threats, or derogatory remarks. Consider the context of the language used. After analyzing each segment, determine whether the overall sentiment of the text is toxic or not. Finally, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

<\prompt>
"|"Here's a breakdown of the text and its toxicity analysis:

*   **""Ryan Bundy seems like a nice, responsible human being who has been sold a bill of goods by his intellectually domineering brother, who he idolizes.""** - This segment is largely neutral. It offers a sympathetic view of Ryan Bundy and criticizes his brother's influence.

*   **""Ammon has a bunch of other similarly situated nutters following him as well.""** - The word ""nutters"" is derogatory and contributes to a negative sentiment towards Ammon Bundy's followers.

*   **""Where? No one quite knows. And, unless you live in Burns no one cares.""** - This section expresses indifference, but doesn't contain overtly toxic language.

*   **""Personally, I am glad these bearded, cammo wearing, narrowly educated , nuisances....are there and not here.""** - ""Nuisances"" is derogatory. The description ""bearded, cammo wearing, narrowly educated"" carries a negative connotation and could be seen as stereotyping and belittling a group.

*   **""Traffic is bad enough. No reason to make it worse with a Constitutional Pagent Play in the Federal Building in downtown PDX.""** - This expresses frustration but is not inherently toxic.

*   **""And, repulsive as their cammo costumes are ( all available at Cabela's and Andy and Bax) with their brandishing weapons it's a very immature male form of exhibitionism....cowboys and indians for middle aged men.""** - ""Repulsive"" is subjective but contributes to the negative sentiment. The comparison to ""cowboys and indians for middle aged men"" is dismissive and belittling, suggesting immaturity. The phrase ""immature male form of exhibitionism"" could be seen as an insult, implying the men are acting out in a childish and attention-seeking manner.

**Overall Sentiment:**

The text contains derogatory terms (""nutters,"" ""nuisances""), negative stereotyping (""bearded, cammo wearing, narrowly educated""), and belittling comparisons (""cowboys and indians for middle aged men""). While it also expresses opinions and frustrations without overtly hateful language, the presence of these negative elements pushes the overall sentiment towards toxicity.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic language. We will use a step-by-step approach to identify potential indicators of toxicity.

**Text:** 'Ryan Bundy seems like a nice, responsible  human being who has been sold a bill of goods by his  intellectually domineering brother, who he idolizes. Ammon has a bunch of other similarly situated nutters following him as well.  Where? No one quite knows. And, unless you live in Burns no one cares.

And,  repulsive as their  cammo costumes are ( all available at Cabela's and Andy and Bax) with their brandishing weapons it's a very immature male form of exhibitionism....cowboys and indians for middle aged men.'

Here's a breakdown of the labels and other relevant information:

*   ('Label definition', 'Indicates whether the provided text contains toxic language, including hate speech, insults, threats, or offensive content directed at individuals or groups.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: 1 indicates the presence of toxic language, and 0 indicates its absence.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Identify potential indicators of toxicity:** Look for insults, pejoratives, stereotypes, or hateful language targeting specific groups or individuals. Consider whether the text contains threats, incitements to violence, or any form of abusive language.
2.  **Assess the severity and context:** Evaluate the intensity of any identified toxic language. Consider the overall context of the text. Are the potentially toxic words used in a clearly ironic or satirical way that negates their toxicity? Are the statements presented as opinion or fact?
3.  **Determine the presence of toxicity:** Based on your assessment, decide whether the text contains toxic language. If the text contains language that is explicitly hateful, insulting, threatening, or intended to demean a person or group, it should be labeled as toxic.
4.  **Output the classification:** Provide the answer in the format: `toxicity: []`. Insert 1 if the text is toxic, 0 if it is not.

Now, apply this chain of thought to the provided text and provide your answer.
<\prompt>
"|1.0|"Let's analyze the text step-by-step:

1. **Identify potential indicators of toxicity:**

*   ""nutters"": This is a derogatory term used to describe the followers of Ammon Bundy.
*   ""narrowly educated"": This is a condescending remark implying that the individuals in question are not intelligent or well-informed.
*   ""nuisances"": While not overtly offensive, it expresses a negative sentiment towards the group.
*   ""repulsive as their cammo costumes are"": This is an expression of disgust towards their appearance.
*   ""immature male form of exhibitionism...cowboys and indians for middle aged men"": This phrase belittles their actions and portrays them as childish.

2.  **Assess the severity and context:**

* The term ""nutters"" is definitely derogatory.
* The other phrases, while less severe, contribute to an overall tone of contempt and dismissal. The author is clearly expressing disapproval and disdain for the group and their actions. The references to ""narrowly educated"" and ""immature male form of exhibitionism"" are condescending and judgmental.

3.  **Determine the presence of toxicity:**

The text contains derogatory language (""nutters""), negative stereotyping, and generally expresses contempt for a group of people. While there are no explicit threats or hate speech, the overall tone and some of the language used are indicative of toxic language.

4.  **Output the classification:**

</prompt>
"||"Okay, I understand. I'm ready to analyze text and classify it for toxicity based on the examples you've provided. My goal is to identify whether the text contains toxic content, marking it as 1 if it does, and 0 if it doesn't.

I will pay attention to:

*   **Direct insults and name-calling:** Phrases like ""idiot,"" ""garbage,"" and similar derogatory terms will indicate toxicity.
*   **Hate speech:** Statements expressing hatred towards individuals or groups.
*   **Threats and incitement to violence:** Any language that threatens harm or encourages violence.
*   **Aggressive and disrespectful language:** Even without direct insults, overly aggressive or disrespectful language can be considered toxic.

I will also consider the overall context and tone of the text.

The last example is a bit more nuanced, and doesn't clearly fit the binary classification. It contains negative opinions, but it isn't clearly toxic.

**I am ready for you to provide me with text to classify.**
"|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a few-shot prompt that instructs a language model to classify text as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). The prompt should include examples of text and their corresponding toxicity labels, adhering to the specified format and including the definition of the label.

Here's the prompt:

<prompt>
You are a text classification expert. You will receive a text and classify if it contains toxicity.
The answer must be in the format: 'toxicity: []', in the square brackets put 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 otherwise.

Label definition:
- toxicity: Binary classification. 1 indicates the text contains toxic language, hate speech, or offensive content. 0 indicates the text is non-toxic.

All the texts are in English.

Example 1:
Text: ""This is a friendly message.""
toxicity: [0]

Example 2:
Text: ""You are a terrible person and I hate you.""
toxicity: [1]

Example 3:
Text: ""Have a nice day!""
toxicity: [0]

Example 4:
Text: ""I will destroy you, you idiot.""
toxicity: [1]

Example 5:
Text: 'Ryan Bundy seems like a nice, responsible  human being who has been sold a bill of goods by his  intellectually domineering brother, who he idolizes.

"|0.0|"toxicity: [0]
"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for classifying toxicity in a given text, adhering to your specifications.

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine whether it contains toxicity. Toxicity is defined as any language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel unwelcome or offended. This includes hate speech, insults, threats, and disparaging remarks.

The classification is binary:
*   **1**: The text contains toxicity.
*   **0**: The text does not contain toxicity.

The text will be in English, and presented as a single paragraph. You must provide your reasoning step-by-step, before giving your final classification. Your final answer must be in the format: `toxicity: [classification]`

Here's an example:

**Text:** ""This is a wonderful and kind message. I hope you have a very awesome day.""
Reasoning:
1.  The text does not contain any rude words
2.  The text does not contain any disrespectful or unwelcoming language.
3.  The text does not contain insults, threats or disparaging remarks.
Therefore, the text does not contain toxicity.

toxicity: [0]

Here is the text you must classify:

Text: 'Ryan Bundy seems like a nice, responsible  human being who has been sold a bill of goods by his  intellectually domineering brother, who he idolizes. Ammon has a bunch of other similarly situated nutters following him as well.  Where? No one quite knows. And, unless you live in Burns no one cares.

</prompt>
"|1.0|"Reasoning:
1. The text refers to people following Ammon as ""nutters,"" which is a derogatory term.
2. The text refers to the people involved as ""bearded, cammo wearing, narrowly educated , nuisances,"" which is a disparaging remark.
3. The text describes the behavior as a ""very immature male form of exhibitionism,"" which while not directly insulting, is a negative judgement and could be seen as offensive in context.
Therefore, the text contains toxicity.

First, read the text carefully and identify any potentially toxic elements. Toxicity can include hate speech, offensive language, insults, threats, or disrespectful comments. Consider the context of the text and the intent behind the words. If the text contains any of these elements, classify it as toxic. If the text is neutral, respectful, and does not contain any harmful language, classify it as non-toxic. Based on your analysis, determine whether the text contains toxicity or not. Then, express your decision in the following format: 'toxicity: \[ ]', replacing the square brackets with '1' if toxic, or '0' if not toxic.

"|"This is a good start! The examples are clear, concise, and cover a reasonable range of toxicity levels. Here are a few suggestions to improve it further:

*   **Variety in Non-Toxic Examples:** Include examples that express different kinds of non-toxic sentiments, not just agreement or observations on civility. This helps the model learn the boundaries better.
*   **Nuance in Toxic Examples:** Add examples that are *slightly* toxic, not just overtly abusive. This helps the model differentiate between strong opinions and truly toxic language.
*   **Explain why the toxic examples are toxic.** Some of the toxic examples might not be toxic to some people, so it is useful to explain the context.

**Key Improvements in this version:**

*   **More Varied Non-Toxic Examples:** Included examples of respectful disagreement, neutral statements of fact or opinion, and positive statements.
*   **Nuanced Toxic Examples:**  Added examples of subtle toxicity, such as backhanded compliments, dismissive language, and ad hominem attacks disguised as polite statements.
*   **Explanation of Toxicity:**  Included inline comments explaining *why* a particular example is considered toxic.  This is crucial for the model to learn the underlying principles of what constitutes toxicity, rather than just memorizing specific phrases.
*   **Longer list of examples:** More examples so the model can learn better.

Remember to test this improved prompt with your model and evaluate its performance.  You might need to adjust the examples and explanations based on the model's specific strengths and weaknesses. Good luck!
"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for classifying text toxicity with a 0/1 output.

<prompt>
First, carefully read the provided text. Then, analyze the text for any language that could be considered offensive, disrespectful, or harmful towards any individual or group. Consider factors such as the presence of insults, threats, hate speech, discriminatory language, or any content that promotes violence or dehumanization. Next, based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity. If the text contains any of the aforementioned elements, classify it as toxic. If the text is neutral or positive in tone and does not contain any offensive elements, classify it as non-toxic. Finally, output your classification in the format 'toxicity: [ ]', replacing the square brackets with '1' if the text contains toxicity, and '0' if it does not.

Text: 'That's good to hear! Does anyone have links to the work he was honored for? Or was it just for general performance? I'd love to explore it.'

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the final classification.

First, consider the definition of toxicity in this context:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone want to leave a discussion. Includes threats, insults, obscenities, identity hate, and derogatory terms.')

Now, let's consider the type of classification:
- ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 otherwise.')

And, the language:
- ('Language', 'English')

Here's the text to analyze: 'That's good to hear! Does anyone have links to the work he was honored for? Or was it just for general performance? I'd love to explore it.'

Step 1: Identify potentially toxic words or phrases. Are there any words that are obviously rude, disrespectful, or offensive?

Step 2: Analyze the context of the words or phrases. Even if a word can be toxic in some situations, is it used in a toxic way here? Does the surrounding text mitigate or exacerbate any potential toxicity?

Step 3: Assess the overall tone and intent of the message. Is the message intended to be harmful, disrespectful, or offensive? Or is it a genuine question or statement?

Step 4: Based on the above analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity.

Final Answer: toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Okay, let's break down the analysis of the text: ""That's good to hear! Does anyone have links to the work he was honored for? Or was it just for general performance? I'd love to explore it.""

**Step 1: Identify potentially toxic words or phrases.**

There are no words in this text that are inherently toxic. No insults, threats, obscenities, identity hate, or derogatory terms are present.

**Step 2: Analyze the context of the words or phrases.**

Since there are no potentially toxic words identified in Step 1, this step is not really applicable.  The context is a polite inquiry about accessing the work of someone who has been honored.

**Step 3: Assess the overall tone and intent of the message.**

The overall tone is positive and inquisitive. The phrase ""That's good to hear!"" indicates a positive sentiment. The questions are asked respectfully. The statement ""I'd love to explore it"" further reinforces the positive and curious intent.

**Step 4: Based on the above analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity.**

Based on the analysis above, the text does not contain any toxicity. There are no rude, disrespectful, or offensive words or phrases. The tone is positive and the intent is to learn more about the subject.

"|1.0|"Okay, I will generate a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying text toxicity, following the given instructions.

Explanation of the labels:

*   `1`: The text contains toxic language, hate speech, or abusive content.
*   `0`: The text is neutral, non-toxic, and does not contain any offensive material.

Language of the text: English

<prompt>
Let's think step by step. We need to determine if the given text contains toxicity. Toxicity includes hate speech, insults, threats, abusive language, and any content that is disrespectful or discriminatory.

Text: 'It's ridiculous that these guys are being called ""protesters"". Being armed is a threat of violence, which makes them terrorists.'.

First, let's analyze the text: The text expresses a negative opinion about a group of people, but it's necessary to consider if that constitutes toxicity. Labelling the people as ""terrorists"" based on them being armed and a perceived threat of violence is a strong statement. This could be considered inflammatory and potentially inciteful. While it doesn't use explicit slurs, the comparison to ""terrorists"" is a severe form of denigration.

Does this text contain elements of hate speech, threats, insults, or abusive language? Yes, the term ""terrorists"" is highly charged and negative, aiming to portray the group in the worst possible light.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the text contains toxicity.

<prompt>
First, carefully analyze the text provided. Consider elements such as insults, threats, hate speech, pejoratives, and disparaging remarks. Deconstruct the meaning of the text, evaluating whether it promotes violence, prejudice, or discrimination against any individual or group.  Next, determine if the language used could reasonably be interpreted as offensive, aggressive, or abusive. Then, if the text contains any of these toxic elements, classify it as toxic and output '1'. If the text is benign and does not contain such elements, classify it as non-toxic and output '0'. Finally, output your answer in the format: 'toxicity: []', placing your classification (1 or 0) within the square brackets.

"|"The text expresses a strong opinion about a group of armed individuals labeled as ""protesters,"" arguing that their armed presence constitutes a threat of violence, thus classifying them as ""terrorists."" While the language is strong and accusatory, it doesn't directly incite violence, promote hatred against a specific group based on protected characteristics, or use slurs. The term ""terrorist"" is a serious accusation, but in this context, it's presented as a conclusion based on the observation of armed individuals potentially posing a threat of violence. Therefore, while the statement is controversial and potentially offensive, it doesn't reach the threshold of toxicity requiring a '1' classification.

**Text:** 'It's ridiculous that these guys are being called ""protesters"". Being armed is a threat of violence, which makes them terrorists.'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, hurtful, offensive, or threatening. This can include insults, name-calling, threats of violence, or language that promotes hatred or discrimination.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's break down the text:

1.  **Identify potentially problematic phrases:** The phrase ""It's ridiculous"" expresses a negative opinion, but it is not inherently toxic. The statement ""Being armed is a threat of violence"" is an observation, not necessarily toxic in itself. However, labeling someone as a ""terrorist"" can be considered offensive and inflammatory.

2.  **Assess the intent:** The text aims to criticize the individuals described and label them with a very negative term. This likely indicates the presence of toxicity.

3.  **Consider the impact:** The language could be seen as offensive and could incite negative reactions towards the group being discussed.

You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to determine whether a given text contains toxic content. Toxic content is defined as any text that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel upset or threatened. Consider aspects such as hate speech, insults, threats, and disparaging remarks.

The text will be in English and will consist of simple sentences. You need to provide a binary classification: '1' indicates the presence of toxicity, while '0' indicates its absence.

Here's how you should approach the classification:

1.  Carefully read the provided text and identify any potentially toxic elements (hate speech, insults, threats, disparaging remarks).
2.  Evaluate the severity and impact of these elements. Consider the target of the potentially toxic elements.
3.  Based on your evaluation, determine whether the text, as a whole, should be considered toxic.
4.  Answer only with the following format: 'toxicity: \[ ]', placing either '1' or '0' inside the brackets.

Here's an example:

Text: ""I think you're wrong, and here's why...""
First. this text does not contain hate speech, insults, or threats.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the provided text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a binary classification approach, where '1' indicates the presence of toxicity and '0' indicates its absence.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

*   **('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to any language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. This includes threats, profanity, insults, identity attacks, and malicious falsehoods.')**
*   **('Label type', 'Binary: 1 indicates presence of toxicity, 0 indicates absence of toxicity.')**
*   **('Language', 'English')**

Now, consider the text: 'Maybe this will cause rents to increase by only 11.1% this year instead of 11.2%'.

Does this text contain any elements of rudeness, disrespect, threats, profanity, insults, identity attacks, or malicious falsehoods? Carefully evaluate each aspect of the text. Explain your reasoning step by step.

After careful consideration of the definition of toxicity, and applying it to this particular text, determine whether this text contains toxicity or not.

"|0.0|"Let's analyze the text ""Maybe this will cause rents to increase by only 11.1% this year instead of 11.2%"" for toxicity based on the provided definition.

*   **Disrespect:** The text is not disrespectful towards anyone or any group.
*   **Threats:** There are no threats present in the statement.
*   **Profanity:** The text is devoid of any profanity.
*   **Insults:** The text does not contain any insults directed at anyone.
*   **Identity attacks:** The text does not attack anyone's identity or any particular group.
*   **Malicious falsehoods:** The text presents a hypothetical scenario regarding rent increases, and it does not seem to be presenting something as a malicious falsehood. It sounds like a possible statement or prediction.

Based on this analysis, the text does not contain any of the elements that define toxicity.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to break down the text and identify elements that contribute to a toxic classification.

First, consider the definitions:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel upset, threatened, or attacked.')
- ('Non-toxic', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and generally inoffensive.')

Now, consider the label definitions:
- ('1', 'Text contains toxicity.')
- ('0', 'Text does not contain toxicity.')

Also consider the label type:
- ('Label type', 'Binary classification')

Also consider the language:
- ('Language', 'English')

Here is the text: ""This is what a serious mental illness looks like, a sociopathic paranoic criminal hysteria, armed and very dangerous....""

Let's break down the analysis:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words/phrases:** Scan the text for words that could be considered rude, disrespectful, or threatening. In this case, ""sociopathic,"" ""paranoic,"" ""criminal,"" ""hysteria,"" and ""dangerous"" could be considered negative or offensive, especially when used to describe a person's mental state.

2.  **Assess the context:** Consider how these words are used within the sentence. Are they used in a neutral, descriptive way, or are they used to attack or demean someone? Here, the terms are used to characterize a person with mental illness in a highly negative way.

3.  **Determine if the language promotes negativity:** Does the text create a hostile or uncomfortable environment? The phrase ""armed and very dangerous"" contributes to a sense of threat and reinforces negative stereotypes.

4.  **Final toxicity determination:** Based on the offensive language and the negative characterization, does the text meet the definition of toxicity? Yes, the language is used to negatively stereotype and potentially threaten a person suffering from mental illness.

Therefore, the toxicity classification is:

toxicity: []

You are an expert in detecting toxic language in online texts. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine whether it contains any elements of toxicity, such as insults, threats, hate speech, or offensive language. You must explain your reasoning step-by-step, and after your explanation, provide a final classification using the format 'toxicity: []'.

Here's how you should approach the task:

1.  **Read the text carefully.** Understand the context and the overall message.
2.  **Identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentences.** Consider the intent behind the words and how they might be interpreted by others.
3.  **Analyze the severity and pervasiveness of the toxicity.** Is it a minor offense, or does it contain high levels of toxic content? Consider whether the text contains stereotypes, prejudice, or discriminatory language.
4.  **Justify your classification.** Explain why you believe the text is either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0), providing specific examples from the text to support your conclusion.
5.  **Output your final classification in the specified format.** Ensure that you only provide the final classification after your reasoning.

Here is an example of how you should format your answer.

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying the text as toxic or not, following the specified format:

<prompt>
First, identify potentially toxic elements within the provided text. Consider aspects like insults, threats, hate speech, offensive language, disparaging remarks, or any language intended to demean or harm an individual or group. Also, consider indirect toxicity, like passive aggressive statements or subtle negative judgements.

Second, evaluate the severity and context of any identified toxic elements. Determine if the language is explicitly toxic or if it relies on implication or subjective interpretation. Consider the overall tone and purpose of the text. Is it intended to be genuinely harmful, or is it expressing frustration or disagreement in a potentially impolite but ultimately non-toxic way?

Third, weigh the identified toxic elements against the overall content of the text. If the toxic elements are minimal or isolated incidents within a larger, non-toxic discussion, it may not warrant a toxicity classification. If the entire text is saturated with toxicity, it will influence the classification.

Finally, based on the analysis of potentially toxic elements, their severity and context, and their prominence within the text, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). Output only ""toxicity: [classification]"", replacing the bracketed term with the numerical classification.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step approach to carefully evaluate the text and arrive at a well-reasoned conclusion.

**Text:** 'Were you around in 2007-08 when the bond measure was being debated? The zoo was repeatedly pitching the reserve to get people to support the bond, but the text did not go into the details. Tony Vechchio was the then-zoo director who went off to Florida as soon as the bond went to ballot, and the reserve was conveniently forgotten.

First, let's define what constitutes ""toxicity"" in this context:

*   ('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or otherwise behavior that could make someone leave a discussion.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, 0 indicates its absence.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's break down the text:

1.  **Identify potential indicators of toxicity:** Look for insults, personal attacks, threats, hate speech, or any language intended to demean or belittle. Are there aggressive statements, or any discriminatory language?

2.  **Assess the severity:** If indicators are present, determine how strong or explicit they are. Is the tone generally negative and antagonistic?

3.  **Consider the context:** Is the criticism directed at an idea or a person? Is the language used inflammatory, or is it simply critical analysis?

4.  **Make a final determination:** Based on the indicators, severity, and context, does the text cross the line into toxicity as defined above?

After careful consideration, determine whether the provided text contains toxicity (1) or does not contain toxicity (0).

*   **Label Explanation**: The label ""toxicity"" in this context means that the text contains rude, disrespectful, or otherwise negative language that could be harmful to individuals or groups.
*   **Language**: The language of the text is English.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Rationale:** The prompt guides the model to first identify potentially toxic elements within the text (insults, threats, prejudice, etc.).

<prompt>

We are building a toxicity classifier. Your task is to read the provided text and determine whether it contains toxic language. 'Toxic' language includes insults, threats, hate speech, disrespectful comments, or any language that could be harmful or offensive.

First, carefully examine the text and identify any words, phrases, or statements that could be considered toxic. Pay attention to the context in which these elements appear.

Next, assess the overall tone and potential impact of the text. Would a reasonable person likely find the text offensive, disrespectful, or harmful? Consider the target audience and the potential consequences of the text being disseminated.

Finally, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). Provide a brief explanation of your reasoning for the classification.

Here is the text:

'You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes. Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.'

Reasoning:

toxicity: []

<\prompt>
"|"Reasoning:The text uses the phrase ""pay his damn taxes like the rest of us,"" which could be considered mildly offensive due to the use of ""damn."" However, the overall tone is more argumentative and critical of the individual's legal arguments rather than directly attacking or insulting them. The text expresses frustration with the individual's attempt to avoid paying taxes, but it does not contain hate speech, threats, or other forms of severe toxicity.

**Answer:** toxicity: [0]"|"Okay, I will generate a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying the toxicity of a given text.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the text provided to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to assess the presence of toxic language, considering factors like insults, threats, offensive language, and disrespectful tone.

First, consider these definitions:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, hurtful, or likely to make someone feel upset or threatened.')
- ('Non-toxic', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and unlikely to cause offense or harm.')

Now, let's define the type of classification:
- ('Label type', 'Binary classification')
- ('Binary Class 1', 'The text contains toxicity.')
- ('Binary Class 0', 'The text does not contain toxicity.')

Also the language used is:
- ('Language', 'English')

Here's the text to analyze:

""You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes. Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court. In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us.

Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.""

Now, think step by step:

1.  **Identify potentially toxic phrases:** Look for words or phrases that could be considered rude, disrespectful, or offensive. Does the text contain any insults or personal attacks?
2.  **Assess the overall tone:** Is the tone of the text generally respectful and polite, or is it aggressive, condescending, or dismissive?
3.  **Consider the target of the potential toxicity:** Is the toxicity directed toward an individual or a group?
4.  **Make a judgment:** Based on your analysis of the phrases and tone, determine whether the text contains toxicity or not.

Therefore, does the text contain toxicity? Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

"|0.0|"toxicity: [0]
"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, incorporating the specified format, label explanation, label definition, and language details.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language. You will be provided with a text passage and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic content. Toxic content is defined as language that is rude, disrespectful, offensive, or threatening. It includes insults, name-calling, hate speech, and any language that could be harmful or offensive to individuals or groups.

The text is in English and consists of simple sentences forming a short paragraph.

The label is binary:
- 1: The text contains toxic content.
- 0: The text does not contain toxic content.

To arrive at your decision, carefully analyze the text for any instances of the characteristics of toxic content as defined above.
Consider the context of the words and phrases used, and whether they could be interpreted as offensive or harmful. Explain your reasoning step by step. Finally, provide your answer in the format: 'toxicity: []', with either 1 or 0 within the square brackets.

Here is an example:
Text: ""This is a friendly and helpful comment.""
Reasoning: The text expresses a positive sentiment and contains no elements of toxicity.
toxicity: [0]

Here is the text you need to classify:
Text: 'You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us.

Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.'
Reasoning: Let's analyze the text for toxicity. The phrase ""pay his damn taxes like the rest of us"" contains the word ""damn,"" which can be considered mildly offensive. Additionally, the overall tone is somewhat aggressive and condescending towards the individual who tried to avoid paying taxes. While not explicitly hate speech or direct insults, the cumulative effect of the language suggests a degree of toxicity.
toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|1.0|"Reasoning: The phrase ""pay his damn taxes"" uses the word ""damn"" which can be considered mildly offensive. While the text doesn't directly insult or threaten anyone, the overall tone is somewhat harsh and expresses disdain for the person attempting to avoid taxes. The phrase ""the hard way"" also implies a negative consequence for the individual's actions, which contributes to the critical tone. Although the text is not extremely toxic, it does contain some elements that can be considered disrespectful and offensive.

People can use toothpaste if they so desire and then spit it out. It's stupid to subject every cell in the body to one of the most toxic substances on the earth by swallowing fluoride.|1|"Okay, I will generate a few-shot prompt for classifying text toxicity, following your instructions.

<prompt>
```text
Here's how to determine if a text is toxic:

*   **Toxicity:** The text contains offensive, aggressive, or harmful language targeting individuals or groups based on attributes like race, religion, gender, etc. It may include insults, threats, or hate speech.

*   **Non-Toxic:** The text does not contain offensive or harmful language. It may express opinions or disagreements respectfully.

The language of the text is English.

Here are some examples:

Text: ""You are a worthless human being and should be ashamed of yourself.""
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""I disagree with your opinion on that matter.""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""That's a really stupid idea, why would you even suggest that?""
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""I think we should consider alternative approaches.""

**Explanation:**

While the text expresses a strong opinion and uses the word ""stupid,"" it's directed at an *idea* (swallowing fluoride) rather than at a person or group. It doesn't contain offensive, aggressive, or harmful language targeting individuals based on protected attributes like race, religion, or gender. Therefore, based on the provided definition, it should be classified as non-toxic.
"|0.0|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity.

**Explanation of Labels:**

*   **Toxicity (1):** The text contains hateful, offensive, aggressive, disrespectful, or abusive language. It may target individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics. It may also contain threats, insults, or malicious statements.
*   **Not Toxic (0):** The text does not contain any of the elements described above. It is neutral, informative, or expresses opinions in a respectful manner.

**Language of the Text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in online texts. Your task is to analyze the provided text and determine whether it contains toxicity. Toxicity includes hateful, offensive, aggressive, disrespectful, or abusive language. Consider whether the text targets individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics. Also, consider the presence of threats, insults, or malicious statements.

First, read the text carefully and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or statements.
Second, assess the context in which these elements appear. Is the language used in a genuinely harmful or offensive way? Is it directed at a specific individual or group? Does it promote hatred or violence?
Third, based on your analysis, classify the text as either ""Toxicity: 1"" (if it contains toxicity) or ""Toxicity: 0"" (if it does not).

Here is the text you need to classify:

Text: 'People can use toothpaste if they so desire and then spit it out. It's stupid to subject every cell in the body to one of the most toxic substances on the earth by swallowing fluoride.'.

Now, think step by step.

The text talks about toothpaste and fluoride.
The text says that it is stupid to swallow fluoride.
'Stupid' is a pejorative term, but it refers to an action rather than a person or group.
The text expresses an opinion about the safety of fluoride.
While the language is critical, it does not appear to be hateful, offensive, aggressive, disrespectful, or abusive towards any individual or group.
Therefore, the text does not contain toxicity.

<prompt>
First, carefully read the following text: 'People can use toothpaste if they so desire and then spit it out. It's stupid to subject every cell in the body to one of the most toxic substances on the earth by swallowing fluoride.'.
Next, consider the definition of toxic language. Toxic language includes speech that is rude, disrespectful, dehumanizing, or expresses contempt towards individuals or groups. Does the text contain any such language? Break down your analysis:

*   Does the text contain slurs or derogatory terms?
*   Does the text express hatred or contempt toward any specific group?
*   Does the text make personal attacks or use insults?
*   Does the text contain language that could be considered offensive or inflammatory?
*   Does the text spread disinformation?
If the text exhibits any of these toxic characteristics, assign a value of 1. If the text does not exhibit toxic characteristics, assign a value of 0.

Finally, output your classification using the following format: toxicity: [].
<\prompt>
"|"Let's analyze the provided text for toxic language:

*   **Does the text contain slurs or derogatory terms?** No.
*   **Does the text express hatred or contempt toward any specific group?** No. The text expresses a strong opinion against swallowing fluoride, but not against any group of people.
*   **Does the text make personal attacks or use insults?** No.
*   **Does the text contain language that could be considered offensive or inflammatory?** The statement ""It's stupid..."" is potentially offensive, as it could be seen as insulting to people who swallow fluoride toothpaste. While not a personal attack, it's a dismissive and judgmental statement. The claim that fluoride is ""one of the most toxic substances on earth"" might also be considered inflammatory, depending on the audience, as it could incite strong negative reactions.
*   **Does the text spread disinformation?** The statement that fluoride is ""one of the most toxic substances on earth"" is a highly contentious and potentially misleading statement. While fluoride can be toxic in large doses, the amounts used in toothpaste are generally considered safe by dental professionals and public health organizations. This statement arguably spreads disinformation, as it presents a biased and potentially inaccurate view of fluoride's toxicity.

Given the presence of potentially offensive language and the potential spread of disinformation, I would classify this text as exhibiting some toxic characteristics.

Let's analyze the given text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will consider elements like hate speech, threats, insults, and disrespectful language.

First, let's define what we mean by toxicity:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, dehumanizing, or promotes violence, hatred, or discrimination.')

Now, let's define the type of classification we are performing:
- ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 otherwise.')

And the language of the text we are working with:
- ('Language', 'English')

Consider the following text: 'People can use toothpaste if they so desire and then spit it out. It's stupid to subject every cell in the body to one of the most toxic substances on the earth by swallowing fluoride.'

Does the text contain any elements described in the definition of toxicity? Break down your reasoning step-by-step. Does the language express hate? Does it contain any threats? Is it insulting or disrespectful? Finally, based on your analysis, determine the toxicity label.

You are an expert at identifying toxic language in text. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine if it contains any toxic elements. Toxicity includes hate speech, threats, insults, offensive language, and any content that is intended to harm, demean, or provoke.

First, read the text carefully and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments.
Second, consider the context in which these elements appear. Is the text expressing an opinion or making a factual statement? Is the language used inflammatory or aggressive?
Third, based on your analysis, determine whether the text as a whole can be considered toxic. A single instance of toxic language is enough to consider the whole text toxic.

Finally, provide your answer in the format: 'toxicity: []', placing a '1' inside the brackets if the text contains toxicity, and a '0' if it does not.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a harmless sentence.""
The text does not contain any toxic language, so the answer is:
toxicity: [0]

We still don't know if the university leaders received the report. Although I have no way to know for certain, I think that the university leaders did receive the internal report and chose to ignore it.'

First, identify any potentially toxic elements in the text. Are there any insults, threats, or demeaning statements? Are there any targets for hate speech?

Second, based on the definition of toxicity, does the identified element constitute toxicity? Does the language aim to harm, demean, or promote hatred towards an individual or group?

Finally, classify the text as toxic or non-toxic. If the text contains toxicity, answer with 'toxicity: [1]'. If the text does not contain toxicity, answer with 'toxicity: [0]'.

"|"The text is an analysis of a situation involving a potential donation to a university. It speculates about the knowledge and actions of university leaders regarding an internal report questioning the donor's ability to fulfill the pledge.

First, there are no immediately obvious toxic elements such as insults, threats, or demeaning statements. The language is relatively neutral and analytical.

Second, since there are no identified elements aimed at harming, demeaning, or promoting hatred towards an individual or group, the text does not contain toxicity.

Finally, the text is classified as non-toxic.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach.

First, define the labels and their meanings:
- ('Toxicity', 'Presence of rude, disrespectful, or otherwise offensive language that could cause emotional harm.')
- ('Non-toxic', 'Absence of rude, disrespectful, or otherwise offensive language.')

Next, consider the type of classification:
- ('Label type', 'Binary classification: each text will be classified as either toxic or non-toxic.')
This means the 'toxicity' label can have only one value, that can be 1 if the text is toxic or 0 if it's not.

Finally, let's define the language of the text:
- ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's analyze the following text:
'Based on all the Oregonian reporting I've read so far, there was an internal donor report that cast doubt on Mr. Fitzpatrick's ability to make such a large gift. We still don't know if the university leaders received the report. Although I have no way to know for certain, I think that the university leaders did receive the internal report and chose to ignore it.'

Does the text contain any offensive language, insults, or disrespectful comments? Does the text target any individual or group in a negative way? Does the text promote violence or hatred?

Here's a few-shot prompt for classifying text toxicity:

**Task:** Classify whether a given text contains toxicity (1) or not (0). Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwise.

**Definitions:**

*   ('Label definition', '1: The text contains offensive language, hate speech, personal attacks, or any content intended to harm or demean an individual or group. 0: The text does not contain toxic content.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification')
*   ('Language', 'English')

**Examples:**

Text: ""You are a moron and your ideas are idiotic.""
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""This is a polite and respectful comment.""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""I disagree with your statement, but I respect your right to express it.""

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a few-shot prompt designed for toxicity classification, following your specifications:

<prompt>
You are an expert at identifying toxic language in text. You will be provided with text snippets in English, and your task is to classify whether each snippet contains toxicity or not. The classification is binary:

*   **1:** The text contains toxic language (e.g., hate speech, threats, insults, disparaging remarks).
*   **0:** The text does not contain toxic language.

The output should follow this format: `toxicity: [classification]`
Do not provide any explanations.

Here are some examples:

Text: ""You are a complete idiot and don't know anything.""
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""This is a perfectly reasonable statement and I agree with it.""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""I think you're wrong, but I respect your opinion.""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""Shut your mouth, you worthless piece of trash.""

"|0.0|"toxicity: [0]
"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed for the task you provided:

**Format of the text:** Simple sentence.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the text contains toxic content. Toxicity includes hateful, disrespectful, aggressive, or abusive language.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (either toxic or not toxic).

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic content in text. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine if it contains any toxic language, including hate speech, insults, threats, or disrespectful remarks.

First, carefully read the text. Then, consider the following questions:

1.  Does the text contain any words or phrases that are offensive, insulting, or demeaning?
2.  Does the text target any individual or group in a negative or harmful way?
3.  Does the text promote violence or hatred?
4.  Is the tone of the text generally respectful and civil, or is it aggressive and hostile?

Based on your answers to these questions, make a final determination:

*   If the text contains toxic content, assign the label '1'.
*   If the text does not contain toxic content, assign the label '0'.

Here's an example of the reasoning process and final answer:

**Text:** ""You are a stupid idiot and nobody likes you.""

**Reasoning:** The text contains the insulting words ""stupid"" and ""idiot."" It also makes a negative statement about the recipient being disliked. This is clearly toxic.

**Answer:** toxicity: \[1]

Now, analyze the following text and provide your answer in the same format.

**Text:** 'Based on all the Oregonian reporting I've read so far, there was an internal donor report that cast doubt on Mr. Fitzpatrick's ability to make such a large gift. We still don't know if the university leaders received the report. Although I have no way to know for certain, I think that the university leaders did receive the internal report and chose to ignore it.'

"|0.0|"**Reasoning:** The text presents an analysis of a situation based on reporting. It expresses an opinion and suggests a possible course of events. The language used is neutral and does not contain any offensive, insulting, or hateful content. The tone is analytical and speculative, not aggressive or hostile. There is no targeting of any individual or group in a negative way.

First, read the following text carefully: 'Awesome!'.

Now, consider what constitutes toxicity. Toxicity often involves language that is hateful, disrespectful, aggressive, or intended to harm or demean others. Does the provided text contain any of these characteristics? Explain your reasoning step by step.

Based on your reasoning, determine if the text is toxic or not. If the text is toxic, assign the value 1. If the text is not toxic, assign the value 0.

Finally, output your answer in the format 'toxicity: []', placing either 1 or 0 within the square brackets.

1. **Hateful:** The word ""Awesome!"" expresses positive sentiment and lacks any indication of hate.
2. **Disrespectful:** ""Awesome!"" is generally considered an enthusiastic and positive expression, not disrespectful.
3. **Aggressive:** The term ""Awesome!"" lacks any form of aggression. It's an expression of approval or excitement.
4. **Intended to Harm or Demean:** The word ""Awesome!"" is used to uplift and praise, showing no intent to harm or demean.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the text ""Awesome!"" does not exhibit any toxic characteristics.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity: ""It was like Bundy was daring the FBI to arrest him...Really glad they finally did.""

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context.
('Toxicity', 'Text that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Contains hate speech, aggressive language, or insults.')
('Label type', 'Binary: 1 if toxic, 0 if non-toxic')
('Language', 'English')

Now, considering the definition, does the text ""It was like Bundy was daring the FBI to arrest him...Really glad they finally did."" contain any toxic elements such as insults, hate speech, or aggressive language directed at any individual or group? The text expresses satisfaction at Bundy's arrest, but it doesn't inherently contain abusive or hateful content.

Therefore, the text is classified as non-toxic.

toxicity: [0]
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Correct. The provided text, while referencing a notorious criminal, doesn't contain hate speech, aggressive language, or insults directed at any person or group. Expressing satisfaction with the arrest of a serial killer is not inherently toxic under the given definition.

<prompt>
First, carefully read the following text and identify any phrases, words, or sentiments that could be interpreted as hateful, offensive, discriminatory, or abusive. Consider whether the text promotes violence, incites hatred, or targets individuals or groups based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristics. Does the text contain any slurs, stereotypes, or derogatory language? Does it dehumanize or denigrate any individual or group? Does it express prejudice or bias? If the text contains such elements, it is likely to be toxic. If the text presents information in a neutral and objective manner, without expressing any harmful sentiments, it is unlikely to be toxic.

Now, apply this reasoning to the text: 'Southern Poverty Law Center reports a 37% increase in anti-
government armed militias in the U.S. since 2008.'.

Based on your analysis, determine whether the text contains toxicity. If the text contains toxicity, answer 'toxicity: [1]'. If the text does not contain toxicity, answer 'toxicity: [0]'.

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Includes hate speech, aggressive or abusive behavior, and content intended to demean, insult, or threaten.')
*   ('Non-toxic', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and contributes positively to a discussion. It does not contain any elements of hate speech, abuse, or threats.')

Now, consider the following label information:

*   ('Label definition', 'Toxicity: Indicates whether the text contains toxic language. Non-toxic: Indicates the text does not contain toxic language.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1), where 1 indicates toxicity and 0 indicates non-toxicity.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Given the text: 'Southern Poverty Law Center reports a 37% increase in anti-government armed militias in the U.S. since 2008.', does this text contain any language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion? Does it contain hate speech, aggressive or abusive behavior, or content intended to demean, insult, or threaten?

The text is a report of factual information. While the subject matter (anti-government armed militias) might be concerning, the text itself simply states a statistic. It does not express any opinions, insults, or threats. It is informative and neutral in tone.

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, following your specifications.

**Format of the text:** Simple sentence.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the text contains toxic, hateful, offensive, or abusive language.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1). 1 means the text contains toxicity, and 0 means it does not.

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic content. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine if it contains any form of toxicity, including hate speech, insults, threats, or abusive language. You will provide a step-by-step reasoning for your classification and then output the final classification in the specified format.

First, read the text carefully.
Second, identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments expressed in the text. Consider the context in which these elements appear.
Third, evaluate the overall tone and intent of the text. Does it promote hatred, discrimination, or violence? Is it offensive or abusive towards any individual or group?
Fourth, based on your analysis, determine whether the text should be classified as toxic (1) or not toxic (0). Explain your reasoning.
Finally, output your classification in the format: ""toxicity: [classification]"".

Here are some examples:

*   **Text:** ""I hate all people of that race.""
    *   Reasoning: The text expresses hatred towards an entire race, which is a clear indicator of toxicity.
    *   Output: toxicity: [1]
*   **Text:** ""This is a neutral statement about the weather.""
    *   Reasoning: The text does not contain any toxic elements.
    *   Output: toxicity: [0]
*   **Text:** ""You are so dumb!""
    *   Reasoning: The text contains an insult, making it toxic.
    *   Output: toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: 'Southern Poverty Law Center reports a 37% increase in anti-government armed militias in the U.S. since 2008.'
</prompt>"|0.0|"Reasoning: This text reports a statistic from the Southern Poverty Law Center regarding an increase in anti-government armed militias. While the topic itself is potentially sensitive and related to groups that could be considered toxic, the statement itself is factual reporting and doesn't express any hateful, insulting, or abusive sentiments. It doesn't promote violence or discrimination.

Output: toxicity: [0]

Here's an example of the reasoning process:

""Sentence: This is a wonderful day!""
Reasoning: The sentence expresses positive sentiment and contains no offensive or harmful language. Therefore, it is not toxic.
toxicity: [0]

""Sentence: You are a stupid idiot.""
Reasoning: The sentence contains the insults ""stupid"" and ""idiot,"" directly attacking the recipient. This constitutes toxic language.
toxicity: [1]

**Label Explanation:**

*   **Toxicity (1):** The text contains offensive, abusive, or hateful language targeting individuals or groups, includes threats, or promotes violence.
*   **Not Toxic (0):** The text is generally neutral, polite, or constructive and does not contain any offensive or harmful language.

**Language of the text:** English.

"|"Okay, here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, suitable for a large language model.

<prompt>
First, carefully read the provided text. Then, consider the following aspects to determine if the text contains toxicity:

1.  **Presence of offensive language:** Does the text use swear words, slurs, or other terms considered vulgar or obscene?
2.  **Disparagement and hate speech:** Does the text attack, demean, or express prejudice against any individual or group based on attributes like race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.?
3.  **Threats and incitement:** Does the text contain threats of violence or encourage harmful actions?
4.  **Aggressiveness and hostility:** Does the text express aggression, anger, or hostility towards any individual or group? Is the tone generally negative and confrontational?
5.  **Respectfulness and Politeness:** Even if the language is not explicitly offensive, does the text lack basic respect and politeness toward the subject or audience?

Based on the above considerations, make a judgment: does the text contain toxicity? If the text contains any of the above elements, or is judged to be toxic based on the combined assessment, classify it as 1. If the text is free from toxicity, or only contains mild bad language, classify it as 0.

Finally, output your answer in the format 'toxicity: []', placing either a 1 or a 0 inside the brackets.

"|"Here's an analysis of the text:

1.  **Presence of offensive language:** The word ""shit"" is considered mild offensive language.
2.  **Disparagement and hate speech:** The text does not contain any disparagement or hate speech.
3.  **Threats and incitement:** The text does not contain any threats or incitement.
4.  **Aggressiveness and hostility:** The text does not express aggression or hostility.
5.  **Respectfulness and Politeness:** The text lacks some degree of politeness due to the use of ""shit"", but it's not overtly disrespectful.

Based on the above, the text contains mild bad language.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step reasoning approach.

First, let's define what we mean by ""toxic content.""

*   ('Toxicity', 'Text that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel bad.')
*   ('Non-toxic', 'Text that is polite, respectful, and unlikely to offend anyone.')

Now, let's consider the type of label we will be assigning:

*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification: either toxic or not toxic.')

And the language we are using:

*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, carefully consider the following text:

""Well shit, they drafted a guide. We should all be good now, whew aht a relief...""

Step 1: Identify potentially offensive or disrespectful words or phrases. The word ""shit"" could be considered offensive depending on the context.

Step 2: Assess the overall tone and intent of the text. The tone seems sarcastic.

Step 3: Determine if the text is likely to make someone feel bad or target any individual or group disrespectfully. The user is complaining in a sarcastic tone.

Step 4: Based on the presence of potentially offensive language and the sarcastic tone, make a final determination of whether the text is toxic.

Therefore, based on the analysis above, is the text toxic or not?

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. The text is in English.

First, identify any phrases or words that could be considered offensive, disrespectful, or hateful.
Second, consider the overall intent of the text. Is the author trying to attack or demean someone, or are they simply expressing a strong opinion?

<\prompt>
"|"Here's an analysis of the text:

*   **Potentially Problematic Phrases/Words:** ""force bred,"" ""exploited,"" ""increase the profit of the zoo"" - these phrases carry negative connotations and accuse the zoo of unethical practices. ""TRUE sanctuary"" implies that the current living situation is not a real sanctuary, which is a direct criticism.

*   **Overall Intent:** The author is expressing a strong opinion about the welfare of elephants in zoos. While the language is accusatory, the intent seems to be advocating for better living conditions for the animals, rather than directly attacking individuals. The author focuses on the alleged actions of the zoo rather than personal insults.

*   **Toxicity Classification:** While the text uses strong language and accuses the zoo of exploitation, it's primarily focused on the well-being of the elephants and not directly attacking individuals with insults or hate speech. It expresses a critical viewpoint but doesn't cross the line into what I would classify as toxic.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach, considering different aspects of the text before making a final decision.

**Text:** 'The elephants deserve to go to a TRUE sanctuary, where they would not be force bred and exploited to increase the profit of the zoo!'

First, let's define what constitutes ""toxicity"" in this context:

*   ('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language that is likely to make someone want to leave or disengage from a discussion. It includes hate speech, aggressive behavior, and offensive language.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, 0 indicates its absence.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's break down the text and examine its components:

1.  **Identify potential targets:** Who is being targeted or discussed in the text?
2.  **Analyze sentiment:** What is the overall sentiment expressed in the text (positive, negative, neutral)?
3.  **Check for offensive language:** Does the text contain any explicit swear words, insults, or derogatory terms?
4.  **Assess the tone:** Is the tone aggressive, disrespectful, or condescending?
5.  **Contextual analysis:** Considering the overall message, is the language used likely to cause offense or harm?
6.  **Determine toxicity score:** Evaluate the identified toxicity criteria in the input text and then classify the text as toxic or non-toxic.
    *   If the text contains toxicity write: ""toxicity: [1]""
    *   If the text does not contain toxicity write: ""toxicity: [0]""

Now, based on the above analysis provide the toxicity label for the input text.
Answer only with: 'toxicity: []'
<\prompt>
"|0.0|"1.  **Identify potential targets:** Zoos are being implicitly criticized.
2.  **Analyze sentiment:** The sentiment is negative towards zoos and positive towards elephant sanctuaries.
3.  **Check for offensive language:** There is no explicit offensive language (swear words, insults, or derogatory terms).
4.  **Assess the tone:** The tone is critical and accusatory, but not overtly aggressive. The phrase ""force bred and exploited"" carries a strong negative connotation.
5.  **Contextual analysis:** The message expresses concern for the welfare of elephants and criticizes the practices of some zoos. While the language is strong, it is not directed at individuals but rather at an institution (zoos) and their alleged practices. The claim of ""force bred and exploited"" could be considered inflammatory depending on the specific context and factual accuracy, but it does not constitute direct hate speech or a personal attack.
6.  **Determine toxicity score:** While the text is critical and expresses strong disagreement, it does not meet the threshold of being rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone disengage from a discussion in a harmful way, considering the definition of toxicity given.

"|"Okay, I will generate a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying toxicity in text, adhering to the specified format and constraints.

**<prompt>**

You are an expert in identifying toxicity in text. You will receive a text and must determine if it contains toxic content. Toxic content is defined as language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel unwelcome or unsafe. This includes hate speech, threats, insults, and offensive language.

The text is in English and consists of simple sentences.

The label is binary:

*   **1:** The text contains toxicity.
*   **0:** The text does not contain toxicity.

Your response should follow a chain-of-thought approach, outlining your reasoning step-by-step before providing the final classification. After the chain of thought, provide the answer only in the format: `toxicity: []`, placing the binary label (0 or 1) inside the square brackets.

Here's an example:

**Text:** ""This is a lovely day.""

**Chain of thought:** The text expresses a positive sentiment and does not contain any rude, disrespectful, or offensive language. Therefore, it is not considered toxic.

**Answer:** toxicity: [0]

Now, analyze the following text:

**Text:** 'The elephants deserve to go to a TRUE sanctuary, where they would not be force bred and exploited to increase the profit of the zoo!'

**Chain of thought:**

**Answer:** toxicity: []

**</prompt>**
"|0.0|"The text expresses a strong opinion about the treatment of elephants in zoos. While it uses strong language (""force bred,"" ""exploited""), it does not directly insult or threaten any individual or group. The language aims to criticize the practices of zoos, rather than being generally offensive or hateful. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for toxicity as defined.

**Answer:** toxicity: [0]

"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a chain-of-thought prompt that will help classify a given text as toxic or not. The prompt should guide the model to think step-by-step before giving the final answer in the specified format.

Here's the prompt:

<prompt>
First, read the following text carefully.
Text: 'um... .it's called a revolution for a reason... sometimes people get hurt during a revolution, if you can't accept that then you definitely shouldn't be in politics because you're bound to get some angry people on one side or another of what you believe, it looks to me you definitely will do better in another line of work.

You can vote for Bernie, or you'll get Trump.'.

Now, analyze the text for elements of toxicity based on these criteria:

*   **Aggression/Hostility:** Does the text express anger, resentment, or a desire to harm or insult someone?
*   **Disrespect:** Does the text show a lack of respect for others, their opinions, or their backgrounds?
*   **Threats:** Does the text contain any explicit or implicit threats of violence or harm?
*   **Insults:** Does the text contain any derogatory or offensive language directed at individuals or groups?
*   **Hate Speech:** Does the text promote hatred or discrimination against any particular group based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.?

Consider each of these criteria carefully. Does the text contain any of them? Explain your reasoning in one or two sentences. Finally, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic or non-toxic.

*   **Toxic:** The text contains elements of aggression, disrespect, threats, insults, or hate speech.
*   **Non-toxic:** The text is generally respectful and does not contain any of the above elements.

The language of the text is English.

Based on your analysis, provide your final answer in the following format: toxicity: []. Fill the square brackets only with 1 if you think the text is toxic, or 0 otherwise.
<\prompt>
"|"*   **Aggression/Hostility:** The text expresses hostility towards those who disagree with the idea that people get hurt during revolutions, and towards the ""corporate establishment.""
*   **Disrespect:** The text shows disrespect towards those who might vote for Hillary Clinton and suggests someone ""definitely will do better in another line of work"" if they can't accept the potential harm of a revolution.
*   **Threats:** The text contains an implicit threat: ""You can vote for Bernie, or you'll get Trump.""
*   **Insults:** The text doesn't contain direct insults but uses condescending language like ""if you can't accept that then you definitely shouldn't be in politics"" which could be seen as insulting.
*   **Hate Speech:** The text does not promote hatred or discrimination against any protected group.

The text contains elements of aggression, disrespect, and implicit threats.

While it includes political arguments, the tone leans toward hostility, warranting a toxicity classification."||"Let's analyze the text step by step:

1. **Content and Tone**: The text discusses political revolution, the Bernie Sanders movement, and opposition to Hillary Clinton and the corporate establishment. The tone is confrontational and dismissive of opposing views.

2. **Toxic Elements**: 
   - The phrase ""if you can't accept that then you definitely shouldn't be in politics"" is demeaning and dismissive.
   - ""You can vote for Bernie, or you'll get Trump"" can be interpreted as a threat or ultimatum, which is aggressive.
   - The overall tone is provocative, suggesting that those who disagree are unfit for politics or must face consequences (Trump winning).

3. **Context**: The statements are politically charged and intended to incite strong reactions, particularly with the ultimatum-like framing of the choice between Bernie and Trump.

4. **Classification**: The text contains toxic elements (demeaning language and aggressive framing), so it should be classified as toxic.

**Final classification:**  
toxicity: [0]"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, along with the requested metadata.

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to determine whether a given text contains toxicity. You will provide your reasoning step by step, and then provide the final classification.

Here are some definitions to guide your classification:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened or attacked. This can include insults, name-calling, threats, and offensive language.')
- ('Non-Toxicity', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and does not contain any insults, threats, or offensive language.')

Here's how you should think step-by-step:
1.  Carefully read the input text and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or statements.
2.  Consider the context in which these words or phrases are used. Is the text intended to be offensive, or is it simply expressing a strong opinion?
3.  Assess the overall tone and intent of the text. Is the primary goal to attack or demean someone, or is it to engage in a constructive discussion?
4.  Based on your analysis, determine whether the text meets the definition of toxicity.
5. Finally provide the classifiction.

Here's the text to analyze:
Text: 'um... .it's called a revolution for a reason... sometimes people get hurt during a revolution, if you can't accept that then you definitely shouldn't be in politics because you're bound to get some angry people on one side or another of what you believe, it looks to me you definitely will do better in another line of work. For the record though, the Bernie movement is more than just voting for the next president, it's sending a message to the corporate establishment that they no longer own the democratic party, that they can pack their bags and leave. That 15% of democrats will under no circumstance vote for Hillary- -I've signed the pact with 50,000+ others, and many who haven't signed still feel and align with us. You can vote for Bernie, or you'll get Trump.'.

Let's think step by step:
The text discusses political opinions and potential consequences of revolution. The phrase ""you definitely shouldn't be in politics"" could be perceived as negative, but it's framed as advice. The overall tone is assertive but not overtly offensive. There is no direct insults or threats. The text expresses strong political views.

Therefore, the text does not contain toxicity.

Let's think step by step. We need to determine if the following text contains toxic content. Toxic content includes insults, threats, hate speech, and generally disrespectful or offensive language. Consider the overall tone and impact of the message.

Here's the text: 'Who cares!? Stark trek and Star Wars fans are all dorks who never get laid.'

First, identify any potentially offensive words or phrases. Does the text contain insults or attacks on individuals or groups? Does it promote hatred or discrimination? Does it use vulgar or offensive language?

In this case, the phrase ""dorks who never get laid"" is clearly insulting and derogatory. It targets fans of Star Trek and Star Wars and makes a generalization about their social lives, implying they are undesirable. This statement is disrespectful and intended to cause offense.

Therefore, based on the presence of the insulting and derogatory phrase, the text can be classified as toxic.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity and determine whether it contains offensive, harmful, or inappropriate content. We will use a step-by-step approach to carefully consider different aspects of the text.

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome.')
*   ('Severe Toxicity', 'Language that is extremely offensive, aggressive, or hateful.')
*   ('Obscene', 'Language or imagery that is sexually explicit or lewd.')
*   ('Threat', 'An expression of intent to inflict harm.')
*   ('Insult', 'Language that is offensive or abusive.')
*   ('Identity Hate', 'Language that targets a group based on attributes such as race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics.')

Now, consider the provided text:

""Who cares!? Stark trek and Star Wars fans are all dorks who never get laid.""

Let's break down the analysis:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** The phrase ""dorks who never get laid"" is potentially offensive.
2.  **Assess the target of the offensive language:** The phrase targets fans of ""Stark Trek and Star Wars,"" potentially constituting an insult based on their interests.
3.  **Determine the severity of the offense:** While potentially insulting, the phrase doesn't contain severe hate speech, threats, or obscenity.
4.  **Consider the overall context:** The context is a general statement expressing a negative opinion.
5.  **Label type**: Binary classification.
6.  **Language**: English.

Based on this analysis, does the text contain toxicity as defined above? Answer with 'toxicity: [ ]', replace the square brackets with '1' if the text contains toxicity and '0' otherwise.

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, keeping in mind the specific format and constraints you've outlined:

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. You will be given a sentence and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic content. Toxic content is defined as language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel upset, threatened, or offended.

First, carefully read the sentence and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments. Consider the overall context and intent of the sentence.

Then, based on your analysis, determine whether the sentence contains toxicity. If the sentence contains any toxic content, label it as '1'. If the sentence does not contain any toxic content, label it as '0'.

Finally, provide your answer in the following format: 'toxicity: []', where you replace the square brackets with your assigned label ('1' or '0'). Do not include any additional explanation or reasoning. Just the label inside the brackets.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a perfectly fine and respectful sentence.""
The sentence does not contain toxicity.
Therefore, the answer should be:
toxicity: [0]

Here's another example:

Text: ""You are an idiot and your opinion is worthless.""
The sentence contains toxic language such as ""idiot"" and ""worthless"" which are disrespectful.
Therefore, the answer should be:
toxicity: [1]

We need to determine whether the given text contains toxic language. Toxic language includes hate speech, offensive terms, threats, or disrespectful comments.

The text is: 'Thanks, Christa! Will you be adding any features to allow overall ""upvotes"" of the article itself? Also, notification settings for users?'

First, analyze the text for the presence of any offensive words or phrases. Does the text contain any slurs, insults, or pejoratives? Does it attack or demean any individual or group? Are there any threats or aggressive statements? Is the tone respectful and civil?

Based on this analysis, determine if the text is toxic or not. If you identify any toxic elements, assign the label `toxicity: [1]`. If the text is free from toxic elements, assign the label `toxicity: [0]`.

Now, perform the analysis and provide the final answer in the required format.

"|"Okay, I can create a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying text as toxic or not.

First, let's identify the key elements that constitute toxic language. Toxic language often includes hate speech, threats, insults, offensive language, and disparaging remarks directed at individuals or groups. It can also involve promoting violence or inciting hatred. Let's analyze the provided text: '""Real freedom""? Freedom to kill wantonly when YOU decide you're in the right? This is why we have laws; both Federal and State; to control the likes of these assholes. They should all be rounded up and imprisoned, all their property taken away to be sold to pay for this travesty they call an, ""occupation"". Pure scum, not patriots.'. Does the text contain any of these elements?

The text contains several potentially toxic elements:

1.  **Insulting language:** The use of the word ""assholes"" is a direct insult.
2.  **Call for Harm/Punishment:** The suggestion to ""be rounded up and imprisoned, all their property taken away"" can be interpreted as a call for punitive action and potentially inciting hatred towards a group.
3.  **Disparaging remarks:** Labeling the group as ""Pure scum, not patriots"" is a disparaging remark designed to denigrate and dehumanize.
4.  **Questionable Tone/Provocation**: The initial question about ""Real freedom"" and the right to kill has a questionable, provocative tone.

Considering these factors, the text exhibits multiple characteristics of toxic language. Therefore, this text should be classified as toxic.

   - ""They should all be rounded up and imprisoned"" suggests extreme punitive action, which could be seen as aggressive.  
   - ""Pure scum, not patriots"" uses the dehumanizing term ""scum"" and dismisses the group as unpatriotic, which is derogatory.  

2. **Tone and Context**:  
   - The overall tone is hostile and includes dehumanizing language (""scum"") and insults (""assholes"").  
   - The call for collective punishment (""rounded up and imprisoned"") and confiscation of property is extreme and could be interpreted as toxic.

Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a step-by-step reasoning process to determine if the text contains toxic elements like insults, threats, or hateful language.

First, define the relevant labels and their meanings:

- ('Toxicity', 'Presence of rude, disrespectful, or hateful language intended to offend or harm.')
- ('Not Toxic', 'Absence of rude, disrespectful, or hateful language.')

Now, let's define the type of label:

- ('Label type', 'Binary classification: either the text is toxic (1) or not toxic (0).')

Consider the language:

- ('Language', 'English')

Here's the text to analyze:

""\""Real freedom\""? Freedom to kill wantonly when YOU decide you're in the right? This is why we have laws; both Federal and State; to control the likes of these assholes. They should all be rounded up and imprisoned, all their property taken away to be sold to pay for this travesty they call an, \""occupation\"". Pure scum, not patriots.""

Reasoning:

1.  Identify potential insults or pejoratives: The text contains the word ""assholes"" and ""scum,"" which are clearly insults.
2.  Assess the tone: The tone is aggressive and accusatory.
3.  Determine intent: The language appears intended to express strong disapproval and contempt towards the individuals described.
4.  Make the classification: Based on the presence of insults and the aggressive tone, the text contains toxic elements.

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for toxicity classification:

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences, often expressing opinions or reactions.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the text contains toxic language. Toxic language includes insults, threats, hate speech, or any content intended to demean, dehumanize, or harm individuals or groups.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1). 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.

**Language of the text:** English

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in online text. You will be provided with a text passage and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic content or not. Toxic content includes insults, threats, hate speech, or any content intended to demean, dehumanize, or harm individuals or groups. You must follow a chain-of-thought reasoning, and output 'toxicity: [0 or 1]'

First, carefully read and understand the text.
Second, analyze the text for the presence of offensive words, insults, threats, hate speech, or any language that targets individuals or groups in a negative or harmful way.
Third, consider the context of the text. Does the language express an opinion in a respectful way, or does it attack or demean others?
Fourth, based on your analysis, make a determination if the text contains toxic content. If the text contains toxic content, assign the label 1. If the text does not contain toxic content, assign the label 0.
Finally, output your answer in the format: toxicity: [0 or 1].

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a great movie, I really enjoyed it!""
The text expresses a positive opinion without attacking anyone. There is no toxic content.
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You are so dumb, I hate you!""
The text contains insults and expresses hatred towards someone. This is toxic content.
toxicity: [1]

"|"This is a good start to a few-shot prompt! It provides clear examples of both toxic and non-toxic text, and includes a case where the text is deemed as neither, using the empty list `[]`. Here are some improvements and considerations to make the prompt even more effective:

**Improvements and Considerations:**

1. **Expand the Example Set:**  The more diverse the examples, the better the model can generalize. Include examples that cover different types of toxicity (e.g., threats, insults, hate speech, profanity, targeting specific groups). Also, include more examples of neutral text covering different topics and writing styles.  The current examples are pretty short and emotionally loaded; we need more nuance.

2. **Vary Toxicity Levels:** Include examples that are borderline toxic (e.g., mild sarcasm, critical commentary). This will help the model understand the boundary between toxic and non-toxic.

3. **Address Specific Edge Cases:**  Consider including examples that might be misclassified, such as:

    *   **Profanity without intent to harm:** ""Oh, shit, I forgot my keys!""  (Answer: toxicity: [] - Profanity present, but not directed at anyone).
    *   **Sarcasm:** ""Oh, great, another meeting."" (Answer: toxicity: [] - Potentially sarcastic, but not overtly harmful).
    *   **Satire/Irony:**  (This is difficult, but if possible, an example could help prevent misclassification)
    *   **Text discussing toxicity:** ""The report details the rise of online hate speech."" (Answer: toxicity: [] - Discusses a toxic topic, but isn't itself toxic).

4. **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent format. Always use the `toxicity:` prefix and either `[1]`, `[0]`, or `[]` for the answer.

5. **Instructions (Optional but Helpful):** Consider adding a brief instruction at the beginning, although few-shot prompts often work without explicit instructions.

**Improved Few-Shot Prompt Examples:**

```
Instructions: Classify the following text as toxic (1) if it contains hate speech, insults, threats, or other harmful language. Classify as non-toxic (0) if it is neutral and does not contain harmful language.  If the text contains potentially offensive language (e.g., profanity) but lacks a clear target and harmful intent, classify it as neither toxic nor non-toxic (empty list []).

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Instructions:** Clear instructions are provided at the beginning.
*   **More Examples:**  The example set is expanded significantly.
*   **Variety:**  Includes examples with varying levels of toxicity, sarcasm, and profanity.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Examples are added to address cases where the text might discuss a toxic topic without being toxic itself.
*   **Targets:** Examples include both explicitly targeted statements (""I hate *you* so much"") and more generalized statements (""They are all..."").  This helps the model distinguish between personal attacks and broader criticisms.

By incorporating these suggestions, you can create a more robust and effective few-shot prompt that will improve the language model's ability to accurately classify text toxicity. Remember to experiment and iterate on your prompts to find the best configuration for your specific use case.

First, read the following text carefully and identify if it contains any toxic elements. Consider whether the text includes any of the following: hate speech, threats, insults, obscenities, offensive language, or content that promotes violence or discrimination. Break down the text into smaller parts, analyzing each sentence to determine its potential toxicity. If the text expresses negativity or aggression towards an individual or group, label it as potentially toxic. Finally, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). Provide your answer in the format: toxicity: [classification].

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach, considering various factors that indicate toxic language.

First, consider the presence of insults, threats, or derogatory language. Does the text contain any words or phrases intended to offend, demean, or harm an individual or group?

Second, analyze the overall tone of the text. Is it aggressive, disrespectful, or hostile? Does it promote violence or discrimination?

Third, consider whether the text contains any hate speech, which is defined as abusive or threatening speech that expresses prejudice based on race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristics.

Fourth, is there any use of profanity or obscene language? While profanity alone does not always indicate toxicity, it can contribute to a toxic environment when combined with other factors.

Finally, based on your analysis of these factors, make a judgment about whether the text is toxic or not.

Here are the definitions:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone upset.')
- ('Non-Toxicity', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and unlikely to offend anyone.')

Here are the label definitions:
- ('1', 'The text contains toxic language.')
- ('0', 'The text does not contain toxic language.')

Label type: ('Binary Classification', 'The label is a binary choice between toxic and non-toxic.')
Language: ('Language', 'English.')

Now, apply this analysis to the following text:

""Did you read this? This lays out a plan to maintain and protect the Greenway. No where does it state the city owns the Greenway. On the contrary, the first page lists what the Greenway will include.""

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier specializing in toxicity detection. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine if it contains any toxic language, hate speech, threats, insults, or any other form of harmful content. You must reason step by step.

First, carefully read the provided text.
Second, identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments. Consider the context in which these elements appear.  Does the text contain insults, threats, or hate speech? Does the text target any individual or group in a negative or harmful way? Does the text promote violence or discrimination?
Third, based on your analysis, determine if the text as a whole can be considered toxic. A single instance of strong toxic language may be sufficient to classify the entire text as toxic.
Finally, provide your classification in the following format: ""toxicity: [ ]"".  Inside the brackets, place '1' if the text contains toxicity, and '0' if the text does not contain toxicity.

Here's an example:

Text: ""You are a useless idiot and I hate everything you stand for.""
First, the text contains insults (""useless idiot"") and expresses hatred. These are clear indicators of toxicity.
Second, the text directly attacks and demeans the recipient.
Third, based on this evidence, the text is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Here is another example:

Text: ""This is a neutral statement with no harmful content.""
First, the text contains no insults, threats, or any other form of harmful content.
Second, the text does not target any individual or group in a negative or harmful way.
Third, based on this evidence, the text is not toxic.
toxicity: [0]

Now, analyze the following text:

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a chain-of-thought approach to break down the reasoning process.

First, let's define what we mean by toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Includes hate speech, aggressive statements, insults, and threats.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification: the text either contains toxicity (1) or it does not (0).')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's consider the text: 'Can general fund money be shifted to paving unpaved streets then, too?'

Step 1: Identify potentially offensive words or phrases. Are there any words used that are commonly associated with hate speech, insults, or threats?

Step 2: Assess the overall tone and intent. Is the text intended to be aggressive or disrespectful towards any individual or group? Does the text promote violence or hatred?

Step 3: Determine the presence of toxicity based on the previous steps. If offensive words or phrases are present, or if the tone and intent are clearly aggressive or disrespectful, then the text is considered toxic.

Based on this reasoning, does the text 'Can general fund money be shifted to paving unpaved streets then, too?' contain toxicity?

 You are an expert in identifying toxic language in online text. Your task is to analyze the provided text and determine whether it contains any toxic elements such as hate speech, threats, insults, or offensive language.

 Toxicity is defined as any language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel unwelcome or unsafe. It includes personal attacks, insults, threats, hate speech targeting specific groups, and excessive profanity.

 Follow these steps to determine if the text is toxic:

 1.  Carefully read the provided text and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or statements.
 2.  Analyze the context in which these elements are used. Consider the intent behind the words and their potential impact on others.
 3.  Based on your analysis, determine whether the text as a whole is toxic. If the text contains a significant amount of toxic language or promotes hatred or violence, it should be classified as toxic. If the text contains only mild or isolated instances of offensive language, it may not be considered toxic.
 4.  Provide your final answer in the format `toxicity: [ ]`. Insert '1' if the text contains toxicity and '0' if not.

 Here's an example:

 Text: ""This is a friendly greeting!""
 Reasoning: The text is friendly and does not contain any toxic elements.
 Answer: toxicity: [0]

 Now, analyze the following text:

 Text: 'Wish the officer could have shot for an arm,leg or stomach. I know that sounds silly . I know how they were taught to shoot and why. I just wish he didn't have to die. The overall impact I feel would have been greater if he would have had to stand trial. Their cause ,(because they were armed) was doomed to end badly. The thought, spot on.'

*   ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, break down the text and identify potential indicators of toxicity:

1.  **Examine for insults or personal attacks:** Does the text target any individual or group with derogatory language?
2.  **Check for threats or incitements to violence:** Does the text express any desire for harm or encourage violent acts?
3.  **Look for hate speech:** Does the text express prejudice or discrimination against any group based on their identity?
4.  **Consider the overall tone:** Is the text generally respectful and civil, or is it aggressive and inflammatory?

3.  **Hate speech:** There is no evidence of prejudice or discrimination against any group based on identity.
4.  **Overall tone:** The tone is somewhat critical and expresses regret about the outcome of the situation. However, it doesn't appear to be aggressive or inflammatory.

toxicity: [0]

**Explanation:**

The provided text expresses an opinion about a sensitive situation (an officer-involved shooting). While it touches on violence, it does so in a reflective and somewhat regretful manner. There's no direct hate speech, insults, threats, or degradation of any individual or group. It expresses a wish for a different outcome and a thought about consequences, but it doesn't promote or endorse harm or negativity in a toxic way.  Therefore, a toxicity score of [0] seems most appropriate.
"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for classifying text toxicity, adhering to the specified format and constraints:

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. You will be provided with a text passage and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic content. Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion. Toxicity includes threats, insults, identity hate, obscenity or profanity.

The classification is binary:
- Label '1' indicates the presence of toxic content in the text.
- Label '0' indicates the absence of toxic content in the text.

The text is in English and consists of simple sentences.

First, carefully read the text and analyze it for any signs of toxicity. Consider whether the language used is offensive, disrespectful, or likely to cause harm or offense to others. Identify specific words, phrases, or sentiments that contribute to a toxic environment.

After careful consideration, provide your answer in the following format:

""toxicity: []""

where you replace the square brackets with either '1' or '0' based on your assessment.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a friendly and helpful message.""
First step: The text is harmless and dosn't contain any type of toxicity.
Final answer: toxicity: [0]

Here's the text you need to classify:

Text: 'Wish the officer could have shot for an arm,leg or stomach. I know that sounds silly . I know how they were taught to shoot and why. I just wish he didn't have to die. The overall impact I feel would have been greater if he would have had to stand trial. Their cause ,(because they were armed) was doomed to end badly. The thought, spot on.'.
</prompt>
"|0.0|"First step: The text expresses regret that the officer had to shoot to kill, and wishes that a non-fatal shot could have been made. While the sentiment is about a violent situation, it doesn't contain any insults, threats, or disrespectful language towards any group or individual. The overall tone is reflective rather than aggressive or toxic.
Final answer: toxicity: [0]

You are an expert in identifying toxic language in online texts. Your task is to determine whether a given text contains toxic content, such as hate speech, insults, threats, or any language that is offensive, disrespectful, or intended to harm or demean others. The text is in English.

First, carefully analyze the text and identify any potentially toxic elements. Consider the context, the intent of the author, and the potential impact on the reader.

Then, based on your analysis, determine whether the text as a whole should be classified as toxic or non-toxic.

Finally, provide your answer in the following format:

""toxicity: [ ]""

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to identify potentially toxic elements before making a final classification.

**Text:** 'I rather like Bernie I'm truly undecided on which progressive candidate I will vote for. I hate the vitriol of Sanders supporters. They need to wake up. I like Bernie's message, but I'm afraid of the voters who say they will NEVER vote for Hillary. Personally, I will be voting for the woman or man who gets the nomination, whoever it will be. I really hope Bernie AND Hillary supporters will come to their senses.'

Here's our process:

1.  **Identify potentially negative or aggressive statements:** Carefully examine the text for phrases or words that express hostility, disrespect, prejudice, or any form of negativity towards individuals or groups.

2.  **Assess the target of the negativity:** Determine if the identified negative statements are directed at specific individuals, groups, or ideas.  Consider whether the negativity is generalized criticism or personal attacks.

3.  **Evaluate the severity of the negativity:**  Consider the intensity of the negative language. Is it mild criticism, strong disagreement, or outright abusive and hateful content?

4.  **Contextual analysis:** Are the negative statements presented as opinions, facts, or something else? Does the broader context of the text mitigate or exacerbate the potential toxicity of the identified statements?

5.  **Classification:** Based on the above analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

Now, let's apply this to the provided text.

*   **Step 1: Identify potentially negative or aggressive statements:** The phrase ""I hate the vitriol of Sanders supporters"" is potentially negative. ""They need to wake up"" can also be perceived as condescending.

*   **Step 2: Assess the target of the negativity:** The negativity is directed towards ""Sanders supporters.""

*   **Step 3: Evaluate the severity of the negativity:** The language (""hate the vitriol"") expresses a strong dislike. However, it's important to note that it targets the *vitriol* (i.e. the hateful speech) of the supporters, not the supporters themselves directly. ""They need to wake up"" is condescending but not overtly abusive.

*   **Step 4: Contextual analysis:** The overall tone of the text is one of frustration and a desire for unity. The author expresses support for both Bernie and Hillary and hopes their supporters will come to their senses. The ""hate"" comment is more about the negative *behavior* of some supporters, and not a blanket statement.

*   **Step 5: Classification:** Considering the above analysis, determine if the text is toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

Third, based on your analysis, determine whether the text as a whole should be considered toxic. If the text contains any elements of hate speech, insults, threats, or aggressive language, classify it as toxic. Otherwise, classify it as non-toxic.
Finally, provide the classification using the format: ""toxicity: [classification]""

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a great movie, I really enjoyed it!""
Reasoning: The text expresses a positive opinion about a movie and does not contain any toxic content.
toxicity: [0]

Here's the text you need to classify:

Text: 'I rather like Bernie I'm truly undecided on which progressive candidate I will vote for. I hate the vitriol of Sanders supporters. They need to wake up. I like Bernie's message, but I'm afraid of the voters who say they will NEVER vote for Hillary. Personally, I will be voting for the woman or man who gets the nomination, whoever it will be. I really hope Bernie AND Hillary supporters will come to their senses.'
Reasoning:
toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Reasoning: The text expresses the author's political preference and concerns about the behavior of some Sanders supporters. While the author uses the word ""hate,"" it is directed towards ""the vitriol of Sanders supporters,"" not the supporters themselves. The statement is an expression of disapproval of a specific behavior, rather than an attack on individuals or a group. Overall, the tone is concerned and expresses hope for unity. Therefore, the text does not contain hate speech, insults, threats, or aggressive language that would qualify it as toxic.

**Explanation of Labels:**

*   `toxicity: 1` indicates that the provided text contains language that is offensive, abusive, hateful, or otherwise harmful. This includes attacks on individuals or groups, threats, and discriminatory statements.
*   `toxicity: 0` indicates that the provided text does not contain any language considered toxic based on the above definition. The text is neutral, informative, or expresses opinions in a respectful manner.

**Language of the text:**

<prompt>

You are an expert in detecting toxic language in online text. Your task is to analyze a given piece of text and determine whether it contains any toxic elements such as hate speech, insults, threats, or offensive language. You must follow a chain-of-thought approach. First, carefully read the text and identify any potentially problematic words, phrases, or sentiments. Then, consider the context in which these elements appear. Are they used to attack, demean, or threaten an individual or group? Or are they part of a harmless discussion or expression of opinion? Finally, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic or not toxic. If the text contains toxicity, classify it as 1. If it does not contain toxicity, classify it as 0.

Here's an example of the reasoning process:

**Text:** ""This is a great movie, I really enjoyed it.""

**Reasoning:** The text expresses a positive opinion about a movie. There are no indications of hate, insults, threats, or offensive language.

**Answer:** toxicity: [0]

Here's another example:

**Text:** ""You are so stupid, I can't believe you even exist.""

**Reasoning:** The text contains direct insults and demeaning language targeted at another person. This constitutes toxic behavior.

**Answer:** toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text and provide your classification:

**Text:** ""Will the protests have a specific call to action for the FBI or other government officials? Or is it a more general show of support for wildlife refuges?""

**Reasoning:**
Let's analyze the text. The text is asking about the purpose of some protests and whether they will specifically address the FBI or other government officials or instead support wildlife refuges. It expresses no hatred, no threats, no insults, and no demeaning or targeted language.

'Will the protests have a specific call to action for the FBI or other government officials? Or is it a more general show of support for wildlife refuges?'

First, let's define our labels:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Text that contains hate speech, threats, insults, disrespectful language, or content that promotes violence or discrimination.')
*   ('Non-toxic', 'Text that does not contain hate speech, threats, insults, disrespectful language, or content that promotes violence or discrimination.')

Also, let's define the language of the text:

Second, consider the tone of the message. Is it respectful and polite, or is it aggressive or demeaning?

Third, analyze the overall sentiment expressed in the text. Is the author expressing hatred, prejudice, or discrimination towards any individual or group?

Based on your analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Answer with 1 if the text contains toxicity, or 0 if the text does not contain toxicity.

**Answer:** toxicity: [0]"|"Okay, I will create a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying text toxicity.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to identify potentially toxic elements.

**Task:** Determine if the given text contains toxic content.

**Definitions:**

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel attacked or offended. Includes hate speech, threats, insults, and offensive language.')
*   ('Non-toxic', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and generally inoffensive.')

**Text:** 'If they offered a Gluten Free Crust we would be impressed, but when we asked about it, they were pretty dismissive of the idea. Thanks Papa Murphy's down the street and Pizzicato in Hillsdale for GF options. We'll stick with them.'

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** Scan the text for words or phrases that could be considered rude, insulting, or disrespectful.
2.  **Assess the intent and context:** Consider the overall intent of the text. Is the author trying to attack or demean someone, or are they simply expressing a negative opinion in a non-offensive way? Consider the context in which the words are used. A word that is offensive in one context may be harmless in another.
3.  **Determine the presence of toxicity:** Based on your analysis of the words, phrases, intent, and context, decide whether the text contains toxicity.

**Label Information:**

*   ('Label definition', 'Indicates whether the text contains toxic content.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1), where 1 indicates the presence of toxicity and 0 indicates the absence of toxicity.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

**Reasoning:**

The text expresses disappointment with a restaurant's lack of gluten-free options and praises other restaurants that offer them. While the author expresses a negative opinion, the language is polite and respectful. There are no insults, threats, or offensive terms used. The author is simply stating their preference and thanking other establishments. Therefore, the text does not contain toxicity.

**Final Answer:**

toxicity: [0]

<prompt>

You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to determine whether a given English text contains toxicity. Toxicity is defined as language that is offensive, disrespectful, or intended to cause harm or offense to individuals or groups. Consider factors like insults, threats, hate speech, and derogatory language.

First, carefully analyze the text provided. Identify any words, phrases, or statements that could be interpreted as offensive, insulting, or harmful. Then, consider the overall intent of the message. Is the author trying to attack, demean, or threaten someone? Is the message likely to create a hostile or uncomfortable environment? Based on your analysis, determine whether the text contains toxicity.

If the text contains toxicity, provide the classification ""1"". If the text is free of offensive or harmful content, provide the classification ""0"".

Output your answer in the following format: toxicity: \[classification]

For example:

Text: 'Have a nice day!'
Reasoning: The text expresses a positive sentiment. There is no toxicity in this text.
toxicity: [0]

Text: 'This is stupid.'
Reasoning: This is a negative statement, and could be offensive based on the context. I will mark it as non-toxic.
toxicity: [0]

Text: 'I hate you all'
Reasoning: The text contains hateful statement. It is an expression of toxicity.
toxicity: [1]

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to arrive at the final answer.

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context.
('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or threatening language. It also includes insults, name-calling, and any expression intended to demean or offend.')
('Label type', 'Binary: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.')
('Language', 'English')

Now, consider the text: 'haha you guys are a bunch of losers.'

Step 1: Identify potentially offensive words or phrases. In this text, the phrase ""a bunch of losers"" is potentially offensive.

Step 2: Assess the intent and context. The phrase ""a bunch of losers"" is used to describe a group of people in a negative way. The ""haha"" at the start suggests the speaker is being derisive.

Step 3: Determine if the overall message is toxic based on the definition provided. Given the presence of a derogatory term and a mocking tone, the text can be considered toxic.

Therefore, does the text contain toxicity? Answer only with: toxicity: []. Place the corresponding label, 1 or 0, in the square brackets.

**Text Description:** The text consists of short, informal sentences, often resembling social media comments or online forum posts. The language is English.

**Label Explanation:** The label indicates whether the text contains toxic content or not. Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or otherwise offensive language that could create a hostile or unpleasant environment.

**Label Type:** The label is binary, meaning it can only have two possible values: 1 (toxic) or 0 (not toxic).

Here's why these changes are helpful:

*   **Explicit Definition of Toxicity:** The first sentence defines what is meant by toxicity.  This is crucial for ambiguous cases.  The addition of ""severe negativity directed at individuals or groups"" provides a broader and more nuanced understanding.
*   **Emphasis on Format:**  Reinforcing the `Answer ONLY with...` instruction helps ensure consistent output, which is vital for automatic processing.
*   **Varied Examples:** The expanded examples cover a wider range of scenarios, including:
    *   **Hyperbole:** `""I'm so angry I could kill him!""` (Exaggeration vs. a real threat)
    *   **Criticism of Policies:** `""That policy is terrible...""` (Targeting ideas, not people)
    *   **Disagreement:** `""You're entitled to your opinion...""` (Polite disagreement)
    *   **Commands:** `""Shut your mouth and listen!""` (Rude, but not always *toxic*, depending on context, but generally hostile so included)
    *   **Generalizations:** `""They're a bunch of lazy good-for-nothings.""` (Targets a group)
    *   **Abstract Criticisms:** `""The system is rigged...""` (Not directed at a person)
    *   **Naivete:** `""You are so naive.""` (Depending on the situation, this can be toxic or can be perceived as so.
    *   **Foolish versus idiotic:** Helps the model understand the nuances between these words.

By providing more diverse examples, you give the model a better foundation for generalizing to new, unseen text. The goal is to teach it to distinguish between genuine toxicity and mere disagreement or criticism. Adding the empty `Text: []` as the final input will show whether the model defaults to toxic or not.

Remember that the effectiveness of this prompt will depend on the specific model you are using.  You may need to further refine the prompt based on the model's performance on your test data.

Here are the definitions we'll use:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Speech that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or dehumanized.')
*   ('Non-toxic', 'Speech that is respectful, polite, and unlikely to offend or harm anyone.')

The label type is:

*   ('Binary Classification', 'Each text is assigned to one of two classes: Toxic or Non-toxic.')

The language of the text is:

*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, consider the following text:

""She already got some 'splainin' to do. What's with the umbrella?!""

First, consider if any part of the text is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or dehumanized. Does the phrase contain any slurs, personal attacks, hate speech, or aggressive language? Does the tone of the text have an intention to offend someone?
Given the definitions above, does the text exhibit toxicity? Answer 1 for toxic and 0 for not toxic.

Therefore, the toxicity level is: toxicity: []

**Task:** Classify whether a given text contains toxicity or not.

**Text Format:** Simple sentences, short informal text messages or comments.

**Label Explanation:** The label indicates the presence or absence of toxic language in the text. Toxicity encompasses hate speech, threats, insults, offensive language, and any content intended to demean, marginalize, or cause harm to individuals or groups.

**Label Type:** Binary classification (0 or 1).
*   0: The text does not contain toxic language.
*   1: The text contains toxic language.

**Language of Text:** Predominantly English, may contain slang or informal expressions.

<prompt>
Let's think step by step. We need to determine if the following text contains toxic language. Toxic language includes hate speech, threats, insults, offensive language, and content intended to demean or harm.

Text: She already got some 'splainin' to do. What's with the umbrella?!

First, analyze the text for overtly offensive words or phrases. Are there any slurs, insults, or direct attacks?  In this case there aren't.
Second, consider the context. Does the language used, while not explicitly offensive, imply negativity or malicious intent toward any individual or group? The expression are used in an ironic way.
Third, based on the analysis of the text, does it contain toxicity? Answer 1 if it contains toxicity, 0 otherwhise.
Therefore, the answer is 0.

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"||"Okay, let's break down the analysis:

*   **Overtly Offensive Language:** As you pointed out, there are no immediately obvious slurs, insults, or direct attacks.

*   **Context and Implied Negativity:** The phrase ""'splainin' to do"" is a folksy or colloquial way of saying someone needs to explain their actions, often used in a playful or mildly accusatory way. The question about the umbrella seems inquisitive, maybe even a little critical, but not inherently toxic.

*   **Overall Toxicity:** The text is arguably mildly critical or questioning, but it doesn't cross the line into hate speech, threats, insults, or language intended to demean or harm. It's more in the realm of being slightly sarcastic or inquisitive.

**Final Answer:**

Based on this analysis, your answer of **0** is correct.

**toxicity: [].**

This is just freaking sad. Another great place lost to greedy developers building more huge apartments in an already crowded area. So long Portland, you are becoming the worst city ever.|1|"Okay, I will generate a few-shot prompt for classifying text as toxic or not.

<prompt>
You are an expert at identifying toxic language in text. You will be provided with text and must classify whether it contains toxicity or not. Toxicity includes hate speech, threats, insults, and generally aggressive or disrespectful language.

The text is in English.

You must answer in the following format: `toxicity: [classification]` where classification is 1 if the text contains toxicity and 0 if it does not.

Here are a few examples:

Text: ""You are a moron and I hope you stub your toe.""
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""Have a nice day, friend!""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""I think you are wrong, but I respect your opinion.""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""Shut your mouth, you idiot.""

**Explanation of the Label:**

*   **toxicity:** This label indicates whether the provided text contains language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel upset, threatened, or attacked. This includes insults, hate speech, aggressive language, and disparaging remarks.

**Language of the text:** English

<prompt>
First, carefully read the following text:

""This is just freaking sad. Another great place lost to greedy developers building more huge apartments in an already crowded area. So long Portland, you are becoming the worst city ever.""

Now, let's analyze the text step-by-step to determine if it contains toxicity:

1.  **Identify potentially toxic phrases:** Look for words or phrases that could be considered offensive, insulting, or disrespectful. In this case, consider phrases like ""freaking sad,"" ""greedy developers,"" and ""worst city ever.""

2.  **Assess the intent and impact:** Determine if these phrases are intended to be harmful or offensive. Are they directly attacking individuals or groups? Are they expressing negativity in a way that is likely to upset or offend others? The phrase ""greedy developers"" is a negative generalization, and ""worst city ever"" is a harsh judgment.

3.  **Consider the overall tone and context:** Evaluate the general sentiment expressed in the text. Is it primarily negative and aggressive? Is it likely to create a hostile environment? The overall tone of the text is negative and expresses frustration and disappointment.

4.  **Based on your analysis, does the text contain toxicity?** Answer with 1 if yes, 0 if no.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach, considering various aspects of the text to arrive at a final classification.

**Task:** Determine if the text contains toxicity.

**Definitions:**

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone upset.')
*   ('Not Toxic', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and unlikely to offend.')

**Label Definitions:**

*   ('1', 'The text contains toxic language, including insults, threats, or hate speech.')
*   ('0', 'The text does not contain toxic language. It may express negative opinions, but it does so in a respectful manner.')

**Label Type:**

*   ('Binary', 'The classification is binary: either toxic (1) or not toxic (0).')

**Language:**

*   ('English', 'The text is written in English.')

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Read the text carefully:** Pay attention to the words used, the tone of the writing, and the overall message being conveyed.
2.  **Identify potentially toxic elements:** Look for insults, name-calling, threats, hate speech, or any language that is likely to offend or upset someone.
3.  **Evaluate the intent:** Consider the author's intent. Is the author trying to express frustration or anger in a respectful way, or are they deliberately trying to be offensive?
4.  **Contextualize the language:** Some words or phrases may be considered toxic in certain contexts but not in others. Consider the context in which the language is being used.
5.  **Provide a classification:** Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or not toxic (0).

**Example:**

Text: ""This is just freaking sad. Another great place lost to greedy developers building more huge apartments in an already crowded area. So long Portland, you are becoming the worst city ever.""

*   **Step 1: Reading the text:** The text expresses disappointment and frustration with changes happening in Portland.
*   **Step 2: Potentially toxic elements:** ""Greedy developers"" and ""worst city ever"" could be considered negative.
*   **Step 3: Evaluating intent:** The author seems frustrated and is expressing their opinion, but not in a directly insulting or threatening manner towards individuals. ""Greedy developers"" is a generalization. ""Worst city ever"" is a subjective opinion.
*   **Step 4: Contextualizing the language:** In online forums, expressing strong opinions about urban development is common. The language is strong but within the bounds of acceptable discourse in this context.
*   **Step 5: Classification:** Based on the analysis, while the text expresses negativity, it doesn't cross the line into direct insults or hate speech. It is expressing an opinion, albeit a strong one.

Therefore, the classification is 0.

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, adhering to the specified output format.

<prompt>
First, carefully read the following text: ""What accounts for the other 1%?"".

Next, consider whether the text contains any language that is hateful, offensive, abusive, insulting, threatening, or discriminatory. Does the text promote violence or incite hatred against any individual or group? Does it use slurs or stereotypes? Does it attack or demean anyone based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristic?

Based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity. If the text contains any of the aforementioned toxic elements, classify it as 1. If the text is neutral and does not contain any toxic elements, classify it as 0.

Finally, output your classification in the following format: toxicity: [classification], replacing ""classification"" with either 1 or 0.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to break down the text and identify any potentially toxic elements.

First, consider the definition of toxicity: Toxicity includes language that is offensive, rude, disrespectful, or threatening. It can also include hate speech, insults, and any language that is intended to harm or demean an individual or group.

Now, let's examine the text: 'What accounts for the other 1%?'.

*   **Step 1: Identify potential targets:** Does the text target any specific individual or group?
*   **Step 2: Analyze the intent:** Is the language intended to offend, threaten, or demean? Is it disrespectful or rude?
*   **Step 3: Check for toxic keywords:** Are there any words or phrases that are commonly associated with hate speech, insults, or other forms of toxicity?
*   **Step 4: Contextual understanding:** Considering the context, could the text be interpreted as toxic even if it doesn't contain explicit toxic keywords?

Based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity.

('Toxicity', 'Presence of offensive, rude, disrespectful, or threatening language, including hate speech and insults.')
('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')
('Language', 'English')

Finally, provide your answer in the following format: toxicity: [].
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Here's an analysis of the text ""What accounts for the other 1%?"":

*   **Step 1: Identify potential targets:** The text doesn't explicitly target any individual or group. The ""1%"" could potentially refer to a group if there's prior context, but in isolation, it's an abstract quantity.
*   **Step 2: Analyze the intent:** The intent appears to be inquisitive. It asks a question seeking explanation or clarification. There's no discernible intent to offend, threaten, or demean.
*   **Step 3: Check for toxic keywords:** There are no keywords commonly associated with hate speech, insults, or other forms of toxicity.
*   **Step 4: Contextual understanding:** Without any context, the statement is benign. It's a straightforward question. If the context *did* involve a discussion about a particular group of people and the ""1%"" was being used in a discriminatory manner, then the question *could* potentially be interpreted as toxic, but based *solely* on the provided text, this is not the case.

Therefore, based on the text provided, there is no evidence of toxicity.

1. **Harmful or Offensive Language**: The text describes someone as an ""idiot"" and implies that their actions were foolish, which could be considered disrespectful.  
2. **Promotes Hatred or Violence**: While the text discusses a violent incident, it does not explicitly promote violence or hatred toward a group or individual.  
3. **Disrespectful Tone**: The phrasing (""an idiot being shot"") is dismissive and lacks empathy, which could be seen as offensive or toxic.  

Given these observations, the text leans toward toxicity due to its disrespectful and offensive language, particularly in its characterization of the individual involved.  

**Output:**  
toxicity: [1]"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, incorporating the requested elements:

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step approach.

**Text:** 'After watching that video, it is lucky more people weren't killed.  Finicum was going for his gun, besides he wasn't at all complying with Law Enforcement. In many ways it appears he was trying to distract Law Enforcement.   It is sort of like watching an idiot being shot after trying avoid a major police stop with guns drawn.'

First, let's define what constitutes ""toxicity"" in this context.

*   ('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or otherwise negative language that could cause emotional harm or offense to others. It includes hate speech, threats, insults, and pejorative or disparaging remarks.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: A binary classification task where the text is either toxic (1) or not toxic (0).')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, consider the following questions while analyzing the provided text:

1.  Does the text contain any direct insults or name-calling?
2.  Does the text express hatred or prejudice towards any group or individual?
3.  Does the text contain any threats of violence or incitement to violence?
4.  Does the text use offensive language or slurs?
5.  Does the text express disparaging or negative opinions about the target of the text.

Based on your answers to the above questions, make a final determination: Is the text toxic or not? Justify your decision briefly, referencing specific parts of the text if possible.

Finally, provide your answer in the following format:

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|1.0|"Here's a breakdown of the text analysis:

1.  **Direct Insults/Name-Calling:** Yes, the text uses the term ""idiot"" to describe the individual being discussed (Finicum).

2.  **Hatred/Prejudice:** While not explicit hatred, the language expresses strong disapproval and possibly contempt towards Finicum, especially given the context of his death.

3.  **Threats/Incitement to Violence:** No, the text doesn't contain any threats or incite violence. It describes a past event.

4.  **Offensive Language/Slurs:** The word ""idiot,"" while not a slur, is offensive and disrespectful.

5.  **Disparaging/Negative Opinions:** The text clearly expresses a negative opinion about Finicum. Phrases like ""lucky more people weren't killed,"" ""wasn't at all complying with Law Enforcement,"" ""trying to distract Law Enforcement,"" and ""idiot being shot"" all contribute to a highly negative portrayal.

**Final Determination:**

The text is toxic. The use of ""idiot"" is a direct insult. While the text doesn't promote violence, it expresses a strong negative sentiment and uses disrespectful language towards a deceased individual, contributing to a potentially harmful and offensive portrayal.

You are an expert in identifying toxic language in online text. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine whether it contains any toxic elements, such as insults, threats, hate speech, or disrespectful language. You will provide your reasoning step by step, and then provide your final answer.

Here's how you should approach the task:

1.  **Read the text carefully.** Pay attention to the words used, the tone of the text, and any potential implications or hidden meanings.
2.  **Identify potentially toxic words or phrases.** Look for any language that could be considered offensive, demeaning, or harmful.
3.  **Analyze the context.** Consider the overall context of the text and determine whether the potentially toxic words are used in a genuinely harmful way. Sometimes, words can be used in a joking or sarcastic manner, which may not be considered toxic.
4.  **Determine if the text contains toxicity.** Based on your analysis, decide whether the text contains toxicity.
5.  **Provide a reasoning:** Explain why the text is toxic, and reference what part of the text lead you to that conclusion.
6.  **Output the final answer.** Classify the text using 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.
    Answer only with: ""toxicity: [ ]""

Here is an example of how to answer the question:

Text: 'This is bad, I hate it'.
Reasoning: The text is classifying a general item to be bad, without pointing to an specific target. Even though the tone could be perceived as negative, the text doesn't imply any toxicity, or hate to any individual or group.
toxicity: [0]

Text: 'You are stupid and your work is terrible'.
Reasoning: The text clearly contains toxic language as it uses insults (""stupid"") and negative evaluations (""terrible"") directly targeted at an individual. This language is demeaning and intended to cause harm.
toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: 'It's truly a golden age of pizza in Portland. I went to Tastebud a few times when it was on Milwaukie; the pizza was excellent, but that space was a little weird. Very cramped and dark.

Meanwhile: Apizza Scholls got new ovens and they're now offering calzones and bread!'.
toxicity: []

First, consider these definitions:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Includes hate speech, aggressive statements, and personal attacks.')

Here are the definitions of the labels we will use:
- ('1', 'The text contains toxic language as defined above.')
- ('0', 'The text does not contain toxic language.')

('Label type', 'Binary classification')
('Language', 'English')

Now, let's break down the provided text: ""It's truly a golden age of pizza in Portland. I went to Tastebud a few times when it was on Milwaukie; the pizza was excellent, but that space was a little weird. Very cramped and dark.

Meanwhile: Apizza Scholls got new ovens and they're now offering calzones and bread!""

Step 1: Identify potential indicators of toxicity: Does the text contain any insults, threats, hate speech, or disrespectful remarks?
Step 2: Assess the intent: Is the author trying to offend, harm, or belittle anyone?
Step 3: Evaluate the overall tone: Is the text generally positive, neutral, or negative? Does it promote a hostile or unwelcoming environment?

Based on your analysis, does the text contain toxicity (1) or not (0)?
Answer with: toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Here's an analysis of the text:

*   **Step 1: Identify potential indicators of toxicity:** The text does not contain any insults, threats, hate speech, or disrespectful remarks. It describes pizza experiences in Portland.
*   **Step 2: Assess the intent:** The author's intent is to share positive experiences with pizza places in Portland. The comment about ""that space was a little weird"" is a subjective observation about the atmosphere of a restaurant, not an attack.
*   **Step 3: Evaluate the overall tone:** The tone is generally positive and conversational.

Based on this analysis, the text does not contain toxicity.

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt based on your specifications:

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine whether it contains toxic content. Toxicity is defined as any language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome.

The text will be in English and will consist of simple sentences and paragraphs.

You must follow a chain-of-thought approach, explaining your reasoning step-by-step, before providing the final classification.

The label is binary, meaning the text either contains toxicity (1) or does not (0).

Here's how to proceed:

1.  **Read the text carefully.**
2.  **Identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or statements.** Consider the context in which they are used.
3.  **Evaluate the intent and potential impact of these elements.** Would a reasonable person likely find them offensive or harmful?
4.  **Determine if the overall tone and message of the text are toxic.** Even if individual elements are not overtly toxic, the cumulative effect might be.
5.  **Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or not toxic (0).**

Here's an example:

**Text:** ""You are an idiot and your work is terrible.""

**Chain-of-Thought:**
The text contains the phrases ""idiot"" and ""terrible,"" which are direct insults. These words are likely to make someone feel insulted and disrespected. The overall tone is aggressive and demeaning. Therefore, the text is toxic.

**Answer:** toxicity: \[1]

Now, analyze the following text and provide your classification in the same format:

**Text:** 'It's truly a golden age of pizza in Portland. I went to Tastebud a few times when it was on Milwaukie; the pizza was excellent, but that space was a little weird. Very cramped and dark.

Meanwhile: Apizza Scholls got new ovens and they're now offering calzones and bread!'

Meanwhile: Apizza Scholls got new ovens and they're now offering calzones and bread!'

**Chain-of-Thought:**
The text describes the pizza scene in Portland and mentions specific restaurants. The description of Tastebud's old location as ""a little weird. Very cramped and dark"" is a mild critique but not offensive or disrespectful. The rest of the text is purely descriptive and positive. There are no toxic words, phrases, or statements. The overall tone is positive and informative. Therefore, the text is not toxic.

First, carefully read the provided text. Then, consider the following factors in determining if the text is toxic: Does the text contain hate speech? Does it use offensive or discriminatory language? Does it target individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability? Does the text promote violence or incite hatred? Based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity. If the text contains toxicity, assign the value 1. If the text does not contain toxicity, assign the value 0.

Text: 'NIGGER'.

Therefore, the text contains toxicity:
toxicity: []

"|"The provided text consists of a single word: ""NIGGER"".

*   **Hate Speech:** Yes, this word is a racial slur and constitutes hate speech.
*   **Offensive/Discriminatory Language:** Yes, it is extremely offensive and discriminatory.
*   **Targets Protected Characteristics:** Yes, it targets individuals based on race.
*   **Promotes Violence/Incites Hatred:** While the single word itself doesn't explicitly promote violence, its historical context and usage are deeply rooted in violence and hatred.

Based on this analysis, the text contains toxicity.

First, read the text carefully and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments. Consider the context in which the words are used.  Then, based on your analysis, determine if the text is toxic overall. If the text contains any toxic elements, even if they are subtle, classify it as toxic. If the text is neutral or positive, classify it as non-toxic.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a nice day.""
Reasoning: The text contains no offensive words, insults, or threats. The sentiment is positive. Therefore, it is not toxic.
Answer: toxicity: [0]

Text: 'I feel for him, and I feel the exact same way just with the abuse I've suffered from people on social media who are Sanders' supporters. It's a shame really. As a life-long democrat, from where I sit, they've done nothing but emulate the Republican party by causing such a nasty division, which in the end, hurts us all. They are the kind of people who make me think about voting 3rd party should he win the nomination.'

Now, analyze the text based on the following steps:

1.  Identify potentially offensive or harmful language: Does the text contain insults, threats, hate speech, or any derogatory terms?
2.  Assess the tone and intent: Is the overall tone of the text aggressive, accusatory, or intended to cause harm?
3.  Determine if any specific individuals or groups are being targeted: Is the text directed at a particular person or group in a negative or harmful way?
4.  Evaluate the potential impact of the text: Could the text be interpreted as promoting violence, discrimination, or hatred?

Based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity. If the text contains toxicity, assign a value of 1. If the text does not contain toxicity, assign a value of 0.

Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to carefully evaluate the content.

**Text:** 'I feel for him, and I feel the exact same way just with the abuse I've suffered from people on social media who are Sanders' supporters. It's a shame really. As a life-long democrat, from where I sit, they've done nothing but emulate the Republican party by causing such a nasty division, which in the end, hurts us all. They are the kind of people who make me think about voting 3rd party should he win the nomination.'

Here's our reasoning process:

1.  **Identify potentially toxic elements:** Scan the text for language that could be considered offensive, hateful, biased, disrespectful, or threatening. Pay attention to the target of these elements. Does it target individuals or groups?
2.  **Assess the severity:** Evaluate the intensity of any identified toxic language. Is it mild criticism, strong disagreement, or outright hostility? Are insults used? Is there any use of stereotypes or prejudice?
3.  **Consider context:** Take into account the overall context of the text. Is it part of a larger debate or discussion? Does the language appear to be hyperbolic or satirical? Is the language used to attack or harm the target?
4.  **Determine the presence of toxicity:** Based on the previous steps, make a final judgment. Does the text contain language that is likely to offend, insult, threaten, or demean individuals or groups? If so, it contains toxicity.

Here are the definitions we're working with:

*   ('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. It can also be defined as any language that is offensive, aggressive, or threatening.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary - indicating the presence or absence of toxicity.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, based on the text and our analysis, indicate whether it contains toxicity or not.

1.  Carefully read the text and identify any potentially toxic phrases or statements.
2.  Consider the context of the text. Would a reasonable person interpret the language as offensive or harmful?
3.  Determine if the text, on balance, contains a level of toxicity that warrants a positive classification.

Based on your analysis, assign a binary label:

*   1: The text contains toxicity.
*   0: The text does not contain toxicity.

You are an expert in identifying toxic language. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine if it contains toxicity.

**Definition of Toxicity:** In this context, ""toxicity"" refers to rude, disrespectful, or hateful comments; threats; insults; or language that belittles, demeans, or dehumanizes individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics.

**Language of the Text:** English

**Instructions:**

Analyze the following text step by step:

1.  Identify any specific phrases, sentences, or words that could be considered rude, disrespectful, hateful, threatening, insulting, or dehumanizing. Explain why you think these elements are potentially toxic.
2.  Based on your analysis in step 1, considering the overall tone and intent of the text, determine whether the text as a whole contains toxicity.

</prompt>
"|"Here's my analysis:

1.  **""These are terrorists.""**: While ""terrorist"" can be a factual descriptor, in this context, it is used to demonize and dehumanize a group of people.
2.  **""They are not people like me.""**: This statement creates an ""us vs. them"" mentality and implies that the described group is fundamentally different and less worthy.
3.  **""They are not Oregonians, but invaders...""**: Labeling them as ""invaders"" is a hostile and dehumanizing act, portraying them as unwelcome and dangerous.
4.  **""They are used to being chased by the law in their own jurisdictions, not used to being the law.""**: This is a generalizing statement that paints the entire group as criminals, which is a form of defamation and prejudice.
5.  **""They are criminals.""**: Similar to the previous point, this is a blanket statement that unfairly categorizes and stigmatizes the group.

The overall tone is hostile, accusatory, and dehumanizing. The text uses derogatory labels (""terrorists,"" ""invaders"") and makes sweeping generalizations about the character and past behavior of the group.

*   **""They are not people like me.""** - This statement creates an ""us vs. them"" dichotomy, fostering division and potentially dehumanizing the targeted group. The lack of explicit reasoning behind this statement makes it problematic.
*   **""They are not Oregonians, but invaders from Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Ohio, Tennesee, Alabama, and more.""** - This segment demonizes individuals based on their origin. Labelling them as ""invaders"" is inflammatory, xenophobic, and contributes to a hostile tone. Grouping these states together implicitly suggests negative traits associated with those states or people from those states.
*   **""They are used to being chased by the law in their own jurisdictions, not used to being the law.""** - This is a generalizing statement that unfairly and negatively stereotypes individuals based on their perceived origins. This constitutes a disparaging remark implying criminality.
*   **""They are criminals.""** - A broad, unsubstantiated accusation of criminality contributes to a toxic narrative.

**Overall Sentiment:**

The text promotes prejudice and hatred by:

*   Dehumanizing a group of people.
*   Making broad, unsubstantiated accusations about their character and behavior.
*   Painting them as ""invaders"" and threats to the local community.
*   Creating a strong ""us vs. them"" division.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to break down the reasoning.

**Text:** 'These are terrorists.  They  are not people like me.  They are not Oregonians, but invaders from Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Ohio, Tennesee, Alabama, and more.  They are used to being chased by the law in their own jurisdictions, not used to being the law.  They are criminals.'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language that is likely to make someone leave a discussion. It can also include hate speech, threats, insults, and disparaging remarks.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary - indicating the presence or absence of toxicity.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's examine the text for potentially toxic elements:

1.  **Identify potential slurs or derogatory terms:** The text uses the term ""terrorists"" and ""invaders."" While ""terrorists"" refers to actions, the use of ""invaders"" applied to specific groups from other states carries a negative connotation and could be seen as dehumanizing.
2.  **Look for generalizations or stereotypes:** The text makes broad generalizations about people from specific states, suggesting they are ""used to being chased by the law"" and are ""criminals."" This is a harmful stereotype.
3.  **Assess the overall tone and intent:** The overall tone is accusatory and hostile. The language aims to separate the speaker and their group (""Oregonians"") from the targeted group, portraying them as outsiders and criminals.
4.  **Determine if the language is likely to offend or alienate:** The language is likely to offend and alienate individuals from the mentioned states, as well as anyone who identifies with those individuals. The negative generalizations and accusatory tone contribute to a hostile environment.

Based on this analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Consider the definitions and the identified elements. Provide a final judgment as follows:

toxicity: []

**Format:** Simple sentences.

**Explanation of the label:** The label ""toxicity"" indicates whether the given text contains language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or offended. This includes hate speech, threats, insults, and disparaging remarks.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification. The label is either 1 (toxic) or 0 (not toxic).

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. You will receive a text passage and must determine if it contains toxic content. Toxic content includes hate speech, threats, insults, disparaging remarks, and language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or offended.

To arrive at your decision, follow these steps:

1.  Carefully read the provided text.
2.  Identify any words, phrases, or sentiments that could be considered offensive, threatening, or disrespectful towards individuals or groups.
3.  Assess the overall tone and intent of the text. Does the text aim to demean, marginalize, or incite hatred against any group or individual?
4.  If the text contains any such elements, classify it as toxic (1). Otherwise, classify it as not toxic (0).

Here's an example:

Text: ""I am going to kill you""
The text contains a direct threat of violence. Thus, the text is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Here's another example:

Text: ""Have a nice day.""
The text contains a friendly message. Thus, the text is not toxic.
toxicity: [0]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: 'These are terrorists. They are not people like me. They are not Oregonians, but invaders from Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Ohio, Tennesee, Alabama, and more. They are used to being chased by the law in their own jurisdictions, not used to being the law. They are criminals.'

**Explanation of Labels:**

*   **Toxicity (1):** The text contains language that is rude, disrespectful, dismissive, or hostile. This includes personal attacks, insults, threats, and aggressive statements.
*   **Non-Toxic (0):** The text does not contain overtly offensive or aggressive language. It might express disagreement or concern but does so in a respectful manner.

**Language of the Text:**

*   The text is in English.

<prompt>

We are trying to classify if a given text contains toxicity or not. A text is considered toxic if it contains rude, disrespectful, dismissive, or hostile language. This includes personal attacks, insults, threats, and aggressive statements. A text is non-toxic if it does not contain overtly offensive or aggressive language. It might express disagreement or concern but does so in a respectful manner.

Here are some examples of how to classify a sentence:

*   Text: ""This is a respectful disagreement.""
    Reasoning: The text expresses disagreement in a respectful way, without using any aggressive or offensive language. Thus, it is non-toxic.
    toxicity: \[0]
*   Text: ""You are completely wrong and an idiot.""
    Reasoning: This text includes a direct insult (""idiot"") and is therefore toxic.
    toxicity: \[1]
*   Text: ""I disagree with your point, but I respect your right to have it.""
    Reasoning: Although disagreeing, the text uses respectful language. It doesn't attack the person, only the idea. Thus, it is non-toxic.
    toxicity: \[0]
*   Text: ""Shut up, you moron! Your ideas are terrible.""
    Reasoning: This text contains multiple insults (""shut up,"" ""moron"") and dismissive language. It is toxic.
    toxicity: \[1]

Now, consider the following text:

Text: ""I have EVERY right to know about the safety of my child. That is why I asked for information and never got it. You sound like you have an agenda.""
First, analyze the text to determine if it contains any rude, disrespectful, dismissive, or hostile language. Does the text contain personal attacks, insults, threats, or aggressive statements? The phrase ""You sound like you have an agenda"" could be considered dismissive and accusatory, implying the other person is not acting in good faith, but there are not overtly offensive or aggressive language
Based on your reasoning, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

toxicity: \[ ]

</prompt>
"|"Reasoning: The text expresses frustration and implies suspicion (""You sound like you have an agenda""), which can be considered dismissive. However, it avoids direct insults, threats, or aggressive statements. While the tone is somewhat accusatory, it doesn't cross the line into overtly toxic language. Therefore, it leans towards being non-toxic, but the phrase ""You sound like you have an agenda"" makes it borderline.

"|"Here's an analysis of the text:

**Statement Breakdown:**

1.  ""I have EVERY right to know about the safety of my child."" - This statement expresses a parental concern and a perceived right.
2.  ""That is why I asked for information and never got it."" - This explains the reason for the previous statement and expresses frustration.
3.  ""You sound like you have an agenda."" - This statement accuses someone of having a hidden motive.

**Toxicity Evaluation (Individual Statements):**

1.  Not toxic. Expresses a legitimate concern.
2.  Not toxic. Expresses a past action and result (or lack thereof).
3.  Potentially toxic. While not overtly aggressive, the accusation of having an ""agenda"" can be seen as accusatory, suggesting dishonesty or hidden motives. It might create a negative or distrustful tone.

**Overall Sentiment and Message:**

The text expresses frustration and accuses someone of having a hidden agenda. The overall tone is accusatory and suggests a lack of trust. While it doesn't contain explicit insults or threats, the implication of a hidden agenda contributes to a negative and potentially hostile interaction.

**Classification:**

</prompt>"|1.0|toxicity: [1]|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, formatted as requested:

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to determine if the text contains elements that are rude, disrespectful, or likely to offend.

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, aggressive, or intended to insult or threaten another person or group.')

Now, let's consider the type of classification we are performing:
- ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates the absence of toxicity.')

And the language of the text:
- ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's analyze the text step by step.

Text: 'I have EVERY right to know about the safety of my child. That is why I asked for information and never got it. You sound like you have an agenda.'

Step 1: Identify potentially offensive words or phrases. Are there any words or phrases that are directly insulting or threatening?
Step 2: Assess the tone. Is the overall tone of the text respectful or disrespectful? Is it aggressive or passive?
Step 3: Consider the context. Could the text be interpreted as an attack on someone's character or motives?
Step 4: Based on your analysis of the previous steps, does the text contain toxicity as defined above?

Now, provide your final classification using the following format:

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|1.0|"Here's an analysis of the text and the final classification:

**Step 1: Identify potentially offensive words or phrases.**

The phrase ""You sound like you have an agenda"" carries a negative connotation. It implies the person being addressed is being dishonest or has ulterior motives. While not explicitly an insult, it is accusatory.

**Step 2: Assess the tone.**

The tone is assertive and somewhat accusatory. The use of ""EVERY right"" in capital letters emphasizes the speaker's strong feeling of entitlement and frustration. The phrase ""never got it"" also contributes to a feeling of dissatisfaction and accusation.

**Step 3: Consider the context.**

The context appears to be a parent concerned about their child's safety. Accusing someone of having an agenda in this context could be seen as disrespectful and casting doubt on their integrity. While the parent's frustration is understandable, the way they express it can be perceived as offensive.

**Step 4: Based on your analysis of the previous steps, does the text contain toxicity as defined above?**

While the text doesn't contain explicit insults or threats, the accusatory language and implied questioning of the other person's motives contribute to a negative and potentially disrespectful interaction. It's borderline, but the accusatory tone tips it towards being considered slightly toxic.

*   **Toxicity is determined by the presence of insults, threats, aggressive language, or statements intended to harm or demean the recipient.**
*   **Polite disagreement, constructive criticism, or neutral statements are not considered toxic.**
*   **Strongly worded statements expressing concern or disagreement, even with accusations, are not inherently toxic, unless they also contain insults or direct attacks.**
*   **The absence of label means that the system has no way to classify the toxicity of the statement.**

We are performing toxicity detection on text. The goal is to classify whether a given text contains toxic language or not. Toxic language includes rude, disrespectful, or offensive statements that could make someone feel attacked, offended, or threatened.

Here's how we'll approach this task:

1.  **Carefully read the input text.** Pay close attention to the words used, the tone of the language, and the overall message being conveyed.
2.  **Identify any potentially toxic elements.** Look for insults, threats, hate speech, aggressive language, or disrespectful comments.
3.  **Consider the context.** Sometimes, language that might seem toxic in isolation is not intended to be harmful when considering the surrounding context. However, err on the side of caution when assessing potential toxicity.
4.  **Assign a binary label:**
    *   **1:** If the text contains toxic language.
    *   **0:** If the text does not contain toxic language.

**Example:**

Text: ""You are a stupid idiot and your ideas are terrible.""
The text contains direct insults and harsh language.
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""I disagree with your point of view, but I respect your right to express it.""
The text expresses disagreement but does so respectfully.

"|1.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying text as toxic or not toxic, with a specific output format.

Here's the breakdown for the prompt:

*   **Explanation of the label:** The label ""toxicity"" indicates the presence of offensive, harmful, or negative language in the text. This includes insults, threats, hate speech, and generally disrespectful or demeaning statements.
*   **Language of the text:** The text is in English.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity refers to language that is offensive, insulting, or intended to harm or demean. We will consider the presence of insults, name-calling, threats, and disrespectful language. The provided text is:'They are a bunch of millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures with too much time to spend on the internet listening to others tell them they are God's chosen. Just another crop of morons getting their just reward, and it ain't gonna be in heaven'.

First, identify any potentially offensive words or phrases. ""Millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures"" is potentially insulting, as it suggests incompetence and failure. ""Morons"" is a direct insult. The phrase ""getting their just reward, and it ain't gonna be in heaven"" implies a negative judgment and possibly a wish for misfortune.

Based on the presence of insults and negative judgments, does the text contain toxicity? Yes, the text contains insults and expresses negative sentiments.

Therefore, the classification should be:
toxicity: []
<\prompt>
"|"You've done a great job analyzing the text and identifying the toxic elements. Your reasoning is sound and your classification is accurate.

```json
{
  ""toxicity"": [""insulting language"", ""negative judgment"", ""name-calling""]
}
```

Here's a breakdown of why your answer is correct and how I've elaborated on it:

* **""Millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures""**: This phrase is indeed insulting as it accuses the group of aspiring to something they can't achieve and failing in their current endeavors.
* **""Morons""**: This is a direct and unambiguous insult.
* **""getting their just reward, and it ain't gonna be in heaven""**: This expresses a negative judgment, implying the group deserves punishment (which isn't heaven). It borders on wishing ill fortune upon them.

Therefore, the text *does* contain toxicity. My addition of specific types of toxicity helps further classify the offensiveness.  Using a list provides flexibility if you wish to expand on any of the categories later.

"|"Okay, I can create a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying text toxicity with a 0 or 1 output.

<prompt>
First, read the following text carefully:

Text: 'They are a bunch of millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures with too much time to spend on the internet listening to others tell them they are God's chosen. Just another crop of morons getting their just reward, and it ain't  gonna be in heaven'.

Now, let's analyze the text step-by-step to determine if it contains toxicity:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** Look for insults, slurs, or language that attacks or demeans individuals or groups. For example, consider words like ""morons"" and phrases that imply inherent inferiority or failure.
2.  **Assess the target of the offensive language:** Determine if the language is directed at specific individuals or a group of people. Identify the characteristics of the target group that are being attacked. Are they being targeted based on wealth, perceived intelligence, or other attributes?
3.  **Evaluate the severity and intent of the language:** Consider the intensity of the offensive words or phrases. Is the language intended to cause harm, humiliate, or incite hatred? Does it promote negative stereotypes or discrimination?
4.  **Determine overall toxicity:** Based on the previous steps, judge whether the text contains toxic language. Consider factors such as the presence of insults, the target of the insults, and the overall intent of the statement. Decide if the text exhibits hostility, disrespect, or malice.
5.  **Classify the toxicity:** If the text contains toxic language, assign a value of 1. If the text does not contain toxic language, assign a value of 0.

Finally, provide the classification in the following format:
toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|"Here's an analysis of the provided text, following the outlined steps:

1. **Potentially offensive words or phrases:** ""millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures,"" ""morons,"" ""God's chosen"" (used sarcastically and negatively), ""just reward, and it ain't gonna be in heaven"" (implies deserved punishment and damnation).

2. **Target of the offensive language:** A specific group of people characterized as ""millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures"" who spend too much time on the internet and believe they are superior due to their association with a particular ideology or belief system (""God's chosen""). The attack is based on perceived wealth, intelligence, business acumen, and religious/ideological beliefs.

3. **Severity and intent of the language:** The language is quite harsh.  Words like ""morons"" are direct insults. The phrase ""millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures"" is dismissive and demeaning. The sarcastic use of ""God's chosen"" implies the opposite – that they are not favored or righteous. The phrase ""just reward, and it ain't gonna be in heaven"" is intended to wish misfortune and eternal suffering upon the targeted group. The intent is clearly to insult, demean, and express disdain for the group. It promotes negative stereotypes about wealthy or aspiring-to-be-wealthy individuals, and those with certain religious or ideological beliefs.

4. **Determine overall toxicity:** The text is clearly toxic. It contains insults, targets a specific group with derogatory labels, and expresses malicious intent. It exhibits hostility and disrespect.

5. **Classify the toxicity:** 1

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step approach to break down the text and identify potential indicators of toxicity such as insults, threats, hate speech, or disrespectful language.

First, let's define our labels:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Presence of offensive, disrespectful, or hateful language targeting individuals or groups.')
*   ('Non-Toxicity', 'Absence of offensive, disrespectful, or hateful language.')

Next, let's define the label type:

*   ('Label Type', 'Binary Classification (0 or 1)') where 1 indicates the presence of toxicity and 0 indicates its absence.

And the language of the text:

*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, consider the following text:

""They are a bunch of millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures with too much time to spend on the internet listening to others tell them they are God's chosen. Just another crop of morons getting their just reward, and it ain't gonna be in heaven.""

Let's analyze the text:

1.  **Identify potential insults or disrespectful language:** The text contains phrases like ""millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures"" and ""crop of morons."" These phrases are clearly insulting and derogatory.
2.  **Assess the target of the insults:** The insults appear to be directed towards a group of people.
3.  **Determine if the language promotes hate or disrespect based on any group affiliation:** While the group is not explicitly defined by race, religion, or other protected characteristics, the language expresses strong contempt and disrespect.
4.  **Based on the presence of insults and disrespectful language, determine if the text is toxic:** Given the presence of derogatory terms and the overall negative sentiment, the text can be considered toxic.

Therefore, based on our analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

First, let's define what constitutes toxic language. Toxic language often includes insults, threats, hate speech, disparagement, prejudice, or any expression intended to offend, demean, or harm an individual or group, also contain rude language. Consider the intent of the author and the likely impact of the statement on a reasonable person.

Now, consider the following text:

'They are a bunch of millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures with too much time to spend on the internet listening to others tell them they are God's chosen. Just another crop of morons getting their just reward, and it ain't gonna be in heaven'.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains any toxic elements such as insults, threats, hate speech, or generally offensive language. We will consider the overall tone and intent of the message.

One of my main reasons for agreeing with the premise (SW>ST) is the John Williams soundtrack, which was a high moment in orginal movie scores, on par with those of epic films like Ben Hur.'

First, identify any potentially offensive words or phrases.  The phrase ""bait for flamers"" could be considered somewhat negative, as it implies an intent to provoke an angry reaction. However, the rest of the text expresses an opinion about Star Wars and its soundtrack. It doesn't appear to target any individual or group with hateful or abusive content.

Based on this analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Answer with 1 if it does, and 0 if it does not.

The language of the text is English.

Therefore, the classification is: toxicity: []
<\prompt>
"|"Based on the analysis, the text contains a potentially negative phrase (""bait for flamers""), but it doesn't reach the threshold of toxicity as it lacks insults, threats, hate speech, or generally offensive language targeting any individual or group.

Therefore, the classification is: toxicity: [0]

"|"Here's an analysis of the provided text:

*   **""Does the author of this piece not know that Star Wars Episode IV was released in 1977, not 1983, or was that just bait for flamers?""** - This part questions the author's knowledge and suggests a potential deliberate attempt to provoke an angry reaction (""bait for flamers""). The term ""flamers"" is mildly negative, referring to people who post inflammatory or abusive messages. The target is the author of the piece.

*   **""One of my main reasons for agreeing with the premise (SW>ST) is the John Williams soundtrack, which was a high moment in original movie scores, on par with those of epic films like Ben Hur.""** - This part expresses an opinion about Star Wars music and is not toxic.

Overall, the phrase ""bait for flamers"" implies a negative view of a specific group and suggests a desire to provoke a negative reaction. This brings the overall sentiment of the text into a slightly toxic zone.

   - ""Bait for flamers"" could imply a provocative intent, but it is not directly toxic in itself.  
   - No insults, threats, or demeaning language are present.  

3. **Overall Judgment:**  
   - The text is primarily opinionated and slightly sarcastic but does not cross the threshold into toxicity as defined (harmful, offensive, or likely to provoke a strong negative response).  

**Final Answer:**  
toxicity: [0]"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, incorporating the requested elements:

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach.

First, consider the following definitions:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Includes hate speech, aggressive language, and insults.')
- ('Non-Toxic', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and contributes positively to a discussion.')

Now, let's define the type of label we'll be using:
- ('Label Type', 'Binary Classification')
- ('Binary Classification', 'A classification task where the input is assigned to one of two categories: Toxic or Non-Toxic.')

Also, note the language of the text:
- ('Language', 'English')

Here's the text to analyze:

'Does the author of this piece not know that Star Wars Episode IV was released in 1977, not 1983, or was that just bait for flamers?  One of my main reasons for agreeing with the premise (SW>ST) is the John Williams soundtrack, which was a high moment in orginal movie scores, on par with those of epic films like Ben Hur.'

Think step by step.
1.  Identify potentially toxic phrases: Are there any words or phrases that could be considered rude, disrespectful, or insulting? Consider the context in which they are used.
2.  Assess the intent: Is the author intending to attack or offend someone? Or is the language simply critical or sarcastic?
3.  Evaluate the overall tone: Is the overall tone of the text aggressive, hostile, or negative?
4.  Make a final determination: Based on your analysis, does the text contain toxicity?

Now, provide your final answer. Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.
<\prompt>
"|1.0|"Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1.  **Identify potentially toxic phrases:** The phrase ""bait for flamers"" could be considered mildly negative. ""Flamers"" is a derogatory term for people who post inflammatory messages.
2.  **Assess the intent:** The author's intent seems to be to call out a factual error and perhaps provoke a reaction from people who are easily angered (the ""flamers""). It's critical but not explicitly attacking a person.
3.  **Evaluate the overall tone:** The tone is critical and somewhat sarcastic. It's not particularly aggressive, but it does contain an element of negativity.
4.  **Make a final determination:** The text uses a slightly derogatory term (""flamers"") and displays a critical tone. While it is not hate speech or overtly insulting, the potential for offense exists.

Otherwise, I will classify the text as non-toxic (label 0). If I am uncertain, I will return an empty list.
"|"Okay, I will generate a few-shot prompt for classifying text toxicity, following your instructions.

<prompt>
Here's a few-shot prompt for classifying text toxicity. The text is in English and consists of sentences or short paragraphs extracted from online discussions. The label is binary: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence. Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or offensive language or behavior. The answer must be provided only in the form 'toxicity: []', where the square brackets contain either 1 or 0.

Text: 'I cannot believe people are this stupid. The article is well researched and explains the topic clearly.'
toxicity: [0]

Text: 'You are completely wrong! Go back to school and learn something!'
toxicity: [1]

Text: 'This is a thoughtful and insightful analysis. Thank you for sharing.'

"|0.0|"toxicity: [0]
"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for classifying text toxicity with binary labels.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in online text. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine whether it contains toxic elements such as insults, threats, hate speech, or generally disrespectful language. You will output a single label: 1 if the text is toxic, and 0 if it is not.

Here's how to approach the problem:

1.  **Read the text carefully.** Pay attention to the specific words used, the tone of the text, and the overall message being conveyed.
2.  **Identify potentially toxic elements.** Ask yourself: Does the text contain insults or name-calling? Does it target a specific group or individual with hateful language? Does it make threats or promote violence? Is the language disrespectful, obscene, or offensive?
3.  **Determine the overall toxicity level.** Consider the severity and frequency of the toxic elements. A single instance of mild disrespect might not be considered toxic, while multiple instances of severe hate speech would definitely be toxic.
4.  **Assign a label.** If you determine that the text contains toxic elements, assign the label '1'. If the text does not contain toxic elements, assign the label '0'.
5.  **Output the label** ONLY in the requested format.

The text is in English, and the format of your response MUST be: 'toxicity: []' (with brackets).

Here's an example:

**Text:** ""This is a friendly message.""
**Reasoning:** The text is a friendly message and doesn't contain any toxic element.
**Answer:** toxicity: [0]

Here's another example:

**Text:** ""You are stupid and your ideas are worthless.""
**Reasoning:** This text contains insults and disrespectful language, which makes it toxic.
**Answer:** toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

**Text:** 'Does the author of this piece not know that Star Wars Episode IV was released in 1977, not 1983, or was that just bait for flamers? One of my main reasons for agreeing with the premise (SW>ST) is the John Williams soundtrack, which was a high moment in orginal movie scores, on par with those of epic films like Ben Hur.'
**Reasoning:**
<\prompt>
"|0.0|"The text contains a potentially inflammatory question (""or was that just bait for flamers?""), but overall, it is primarily focused on discussing Star Wars and Star Trek. The language is not overtly hateful, threatening, or insulting. The potentially inflammatory question is mild and does not rise to the level of toxic language.

2. **Content**: The criticism is specific to the layout (e.g., ""thin wall,"" ""dining table OR living room set,"" ""useless square ft""). While hyperbolic, it focuses on the perceived impracticality of the space, not personal attacks.

3. **Intent**: The author is venting about a housing issue, not targeting individuals with insults or malice. The sarcasm (""Yeah, because I want..."") is mocking the design choices, not demeaning people.

4. **Comparison to Toxicity**: Toxic language would include insults (e.g., ""The architects are idiots""), hate speech, or aggressive personal attacks, which are absent here.

'Took this as an opportunity to check back in on The Yard and the floorplans are finally up and they are ATROCIOUS.  Yeah, because I want to spend 2500+ to share a thin wall with my roommate.  Oh, and I want to pick between a dining table OR living room set, because in this modern world you can't have both.  And if you do want both, one is going to be in a tiny spot by your door and the other is going to be down a long hallway of useless square ft next to your kitchenette.  So dumb.
http://yardpdx.com/leasing/'

First, let's define what we mean by toxicity.

('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language that is likely to make someone feel offended or unwelcome.')
('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')
('Language', 'English')

Now, let's examine the text.

*   **Sentence 1:** ""Took this as an opportunity to check back in on The Yard and the floorplans are finally up and they are ATROCIOUS.""  The word ""ATROCIOUS"" could be considered negative, but it's directed at the floorplans, not a person. Is this toxic?
*   **Sentence 2:** ""Yeah, because I want to spend 2500+ to share a thin wall with my roommate."" Expresses frustration. Is this toxic?
*   **Sentence 3:** ""Oh, and I want to pick between a dining table OR living room set, because in this modern world you can't have both."" Expresses frustration. Is this toxic?
*   **Sentence 4:** ""And if you do want both, one is going to be in a tiny spot by your door and the other is going to be down a long hallway of useless square ft next to your kitchenette."" Expresses frustration. Is this toxic?
*   **Sentence 5:** ""So dumb."" This is a negative statement, but again, directed at the situation (the floorplan design), not a person. Is this toxic?

Considering all these points, does the text contain toxicity as we've defined it? Is the poster being rude or disrespectful or just expressing their frustration with floorplans?

Based on your analysis, provide your final answer in the following format:

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"The text expresses strong dissatisfaction with the floorplans of a building complex, using negative terms like ""atrocious"" and ""dumb."" However, the language is directed at the *design* and the situation it creates. The author is expressing frustration with the perceived shortcomings of the floorplans and the limitations they impose on potential residents.

There are no personal attacks, insults, or language intended to offend or belittle individuals. The tone is critical and disappointed, but not toxic as defined. The text doesn't include any language that would make someone feel unwelcome or offended in a personal way.

You are an expert text classifier specializing in identifying toxicity in online text. Your task is to analyze the provided text and determine whether it contains toxic content. Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or otherwise offensive language that could potentially upset or harm someone.

Here's how to approach this task using a chain of thought:

1.  **Understand the Text:** Carefully read the text and identify the main points and sentiments expressed. Pay attention to any negative or aggressive language.
2.  **Identify Potential Toxicity:** Look for specific words, phrases, or statements that could be considered offensive, disrespectful, or harmful. Consider the context in which these elements are used.
3.  **Assess the Overall Tone:** Evaluate the overall tone and sentiment of the text. Is it generally negative, hostile, or aggressive?
4.  **Determine the Presence of Toxicity:** Based on your analysis, decide whether the text contains toxic content.
5.  **Assign the Label:** If the text contains toxic content, assign the label ""1"". If the text does not contain toxic content, assign the label ""0"".

Here is the text:

'Took this as an opportunity to check back in on The Yard and the floorpans are finally up and they are ATROCIOUS.  Yeah, because I want to spend 2500+ to share a thin wall with my roommate.

"|0.0|"Here's my analysis:

1. **Understand the Text:** The author is complaining about the floor plans of an apartment complex called ""The Yard."" They express frustration with the high cost and perceived poor design, particularly the lack of space and the need to choose between a dining table or living room set.

2. **Identify Potential Toxicity:** The language used is negative and critical. The word ""ATROCIOUS"" is strong, and phrases like ""So dumb"" express strong disapproval. However, the criticism is directed at the floor plans and the apartment complex, not at any individual or group of people.

3. **Assess the Overall Tone:** The tone is frustrated and sarcastic, but not overtly hostile or offensive. The author is expressing dissatisfaction, but not in a way that is intended to harm or upset anyone personally.

4. **Determine the Presence of Toxicity:** While the language is negative and critical, it doesn't rise to the level of being toxic. It's an expression of personal frustration and opinion, not an attack on anyone.

5. **Assign the Label:** Based on my analysis, the text does not contain toxic content.

"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a chain-of-thought prompt that will help classify a given text as either containing toxicity (1) or not (0). The prompt should guide the model to first analyze the text for potentially toxic elements before making a final classification.

Here's the prompt:

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine whether it contains any elements of toxicity, such as insults, aggression, disrespect, or offensive language.

Here's how you should approach the task:

1.  **Read the text carefully:** Pay close attention to the specific words used, the overall tone, and the context in which the words are used.
2.  **Identify potential toxic elements:** Look for insults, personal attacks, disrespectful language, or any other form of communication that could be considered offensive or harmful. Consider the target of the potentially toxic language and the impact it could have.
3.  **Assess the severity of the toxicity:** Determine whether the potential toxic elements are mild, moderate, or severe. Consider the overall impact of the text and the likelihood that it would be considered offensive or harmful by a reasonable person.
4.  **Classify the text:** Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or not toxic (0).

**Label Explanation:**
*   **Toxicity (1):** The text contains elements of insults, aggression, disrespect, or offensive language that could be considered harmful or offensive to individuals or groups.
*   **Not Toxicity (0):** The text does not contain any elements of insults, aggression, disrespect, or offensive language. The text is neutral or positive in tone.

**Language of the text:** English

**Example:**

""I think your idea is stupid, and you are a terrible person for suggesting it.""
This text contains a personal attack and disrespectful language. Therefore, it would be classified as toxic (1).

""That's an interesting point of view. I hadn't considered that before.""
This text is neutral and does not contain any toxic elements. Therefore, it would be classified as not toxic (0).

Now, analyze the following text and provide your classification in the format ""toxicity: [classification]""

Text: '""Anybody who can kiss that many asses, that quickly, is so primed for success in the American workplace that they don't need your crappy restaurant job.""

"|"Let's analyze the text for toxicity:

*   **""Anybody who can kiss that many asses, that quickly, is so primed for success in the American workplace that they don't need your crappy restaurant job.""** - This sentence uses derogatory language (""kiss that many asses,"" ""crappy"") and implies a negative judgment about someone's character and career choices. While not explicitly targeting a specific person with hate speech, it uses harsh and demeaning language.

*   **""^This.""** - This phrase simply expresses agreement and is not inherently toxic.

*   **""Also, having been both the chatty person and the languishing-in-line-behind-the-chatty-person person, I think the best thing to do is smile and get over it.""** - This sentence expresses a personal opinion and suggests a coping mechanism. It does not contain any offensive or harmful elements.

The first sentence contains derogatory language and expresses a negative sentiment, indicating a degree of toxicity. Therefore, the overall text leans towards being toxic.

1. **Understanding the text**: The text appears to be a critique of someone's behavior in a workplace or service setting, with a sarcastic tone.

2. **Identifying toxic elements**:
   - First part: ""Anybody who can kiss that many asses, that quickly, is so primed for success in the American workplace that they don't need your crappy restaurant job.""
     - ""Kiss that many asses"" is a vulgar and derogatory phrase implying insincere flattery.
     - ""Crappy restaurant job"" is dismissive and insulting to service industry work.
     - The tone is hostile and mocking.

   - Second part: ""Also, having been both the chatty person and the languishing-in-line-behind-the-chatty-person person, I think the best thing to do is smile and get over it.""
     - ""Languishing-in-line-behind-the-chatty-person"" is mildly critical but not overtly toxic.
     - The advice to ""smile and get over it"" is passive-aggressive but not severely toxic on its own.

3. **First part analysis**: Clearly contains toxicity due to insults (""kiss asses""), derogatory language (""crappy""), and hostile sarcasm.

4. **Second part analysis**: Mildly negative but not overtly toxic. The passive-aggressive tone doesn't rise to the level of toxicity when isolated.

**Answer format:** toxicity: [1]"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, adhering to the specified format and including the required label definitions and metadata.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text and determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a binary classification approach, where '1' indicates the presence of toxicity and '0' indicates its absence. Consider elements like insults, aggression, hate speech, or generally offensive language when making your assessment.

Here are the definitions we'll use:

- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone want to leave a discussion. It can include insults, threats, or offensive language.')
- ('Non-Toxicity', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and contributes positively to a discussion.')

Here is the label type:

- ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')

Here is the language:

- ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's apply this to the text:

Text: ""Anybody who can kiss that many asses, that quickly, is so primed for success in the American workplace that they don't need your crappy restaurant job.""

""^This.

Also, having been both the chatty person and the languishing-in-line-behind-the-chatty-person person, I think the best thing to do is smile and get over it.""

First, carefully read the text and identify potentially toxic elements. Does the text contain insults, threats, or offensive language? Does it express negativity or disrespect towards a person, group or the situation? Explain your reasoning step by step. Finally, give a final answer using this format: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

"|1.0|"Let's analyze the provided text for toxicity.

The first part of the text, ""Anybody who can kiss that many asses, that quickly, is so primed for success in the American workplace that they don't need your crappy restaurant job,"" uses the phrase ""kiss that many asses,"" which is considered vulgar and disrespectful. It also uses the term ""crappy"" to describe the restaurant job, which can be seen as insulting or demeaning. This part of the text expresses negativity and disrespect.

The second part of the text, ""^This. Also, having been both the chatty person and the languishing-in-line-behind-the-chatty-person person, I think the best thing to do is smile and get over it,"" expresses a suggestion and doesn't appear to contain any insults, threats, or offensive language. It's more of an opinion or advice.

Considering the first part of the text contains vulgar and disrespectful language, the overall text can be categorized as containing toxicity.

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for classifying text toxicity, adhering to the specified format and constraints.

**Explanation of the Label:**

The label ""toxicity"" refers to the presence of rude, disrespectful, or offensive language, personal attacks, or any content that could be harmful or offensive to individuals or groups.

**Definition of the Type of the Label:**

The label type is binary classification. It has two possible values:

*   0: Indicates the text does not contain toxicity.
*   1: Indicates the text contains toxicity.

**Language of the Text:**

The language of the text is English.

<prompt>

You are an expert in identifying toxic language in online text. You will be provided with a text excerpt, and your task is to determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity includes rudeness, disrespect, offensive language, personal attacks, or any content that could be harmful or offensive to individuals or groups.

Follow these steps:

1.  Carefully read the provided text.
2.  Identify any sentences or phrases that could be considered rude, disrespectful, offensive, or a personal attack.
3.  Consider the overall tone and intent of the text. Does the text aim to harm, insult, or demean?

"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a chain-of-thought prompt that will guide a language model to classify a given text as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). The prompt should also specify the language of the text and the expected output format.

Here's the prompt:

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity includes hate speech, threats, insults, and offensive language. We will break down the text to identify potentially toxic elements and then assign a label based on our findings. The language of the text is English.

**Text:** 'Troll trolly troll. What now?'

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Examine the text for hate speech:** Does the text target any individual or group based on their identity?
2.  **Examine the text for threats:** Does the text contain any explicit or implicit threats of violence or harm?
3.  **Examine the text for insults:** Does the text contain any derogatory or offensive terms directed at an individual or group? The word ""troll"" may be considered insulting.
4.  **Examine the text for offensive language:** Does the text contain any profanity, slurs, or other language that could be considered offensive? The repetition of the word ""troll"" might be considered offensive in certain contexts, especially if directed towards someone.
5.  **Assess the overall context:** Considering all the above, does the text, as a whole, express toxicity? The text employs the word ""troll"" which is frequently associated with negative online behaviors.

**Labeling:**

*   **Toxicity (1):** The text contains hate speech, threats, insults, or offensive language.
*   **Not Toxic (0):** The text does not contain hate speech, threats, insults, or offensive language.

Based on the above analysis, determine whether the text is toxic or not.

"|"Okay, that's a good start! Now let's refine and expand that into a complete prompt ready to be fed into a language model. Here's a revised version that incorporates some best practices:

```
Classify the following text as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).  Toxicity includes insults, threats, hate speech, and abusive language.  Focus on the *intent* and *impact* of the words, not just the presence of particular keywords.

Text: ""This is a friendly greeting. How are you?""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You are absolutely disgusting and should be ashamed of yourself.""
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""Have a wonderful day filled with joy and laughter!""
toxicity: [0]

toxicity: [1]

Text: ""I disagree with your opinion, but I respect your right to have it.""

Text: ""The weather is beautiful today.""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You are a racist, sexist pig and I hope you die.""
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""Troll trolly troll. What now?""
toxicity: []
```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Clear Task Definition:** The initial sentence directly states the task. This is crucial for the model to understand what is expected. ""Classify the following text as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).""
* **Definition of Toxicity:**  The second sentence *defines* toxicity.  This is hugely important because ""toxicity"" is a subjective term.  Providing concrete examples (insults, threats, hate speech, abusive language) helps ground the model.
* **Focus on Intent and Impact:**  This is critical for handling more subtle cases.  The model shouldn't rely solely on keyword matching, but consider *why* and *how* the words are used. This helps with nuance.
* **More Examples:** More examples generally improve few-shot performance. I've added examples to cover more diverse cases.  Specifically:
    * **Disagreement vs. Attack:** Differentiates between respectful disagreement and toxic attacks.
    * **Neutral Statement:** Provides a clear example of a non-toxic, completely unrelated statement.
    * **Stronger Toxic Example:**  Includes a more overtly hateful statement to reinforce the upper end of the toxicity scale.
* **Open Question at the End:** The final example with the empty `toxicity: []` is the query the model should fill in.  This signals to the model that it should predict the toxicity label for this text.
* **Concise and Direct:** The prompt is written in a straightforward, unambiguous manner.
* **Explicit Instructions:** Using words like ""Classify"" explicitly tells the model what action to perform.

**Why these changes are important:**

* **Reduced Ambiguity:** A clear definition of toxicity helps the model understand the desired classification criteria. Without it, the model might interpret ""toxicity"" differently.
* **Improved Generalization:**  More diverse examples help the model generalize to unseen text and handle edge cases.
* **Better Performance on Edge Cases:** The ""intent and impact"" instruction helps the model handle cases where the language is subtly toxic or uses coded language.

**How to use this prompt:**

1.  **Input the entire prompt into your language model.**
2.  **The model should output either `[0]` or `[1]` after the last example.**

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Model Selection:**  The performance of this prompt will vary depending on the underlying language model.  Larger and more capable models generally perform better.
*   **Data Bias:**  Be aware that the model will likely inherit biases present in its training data.  It's important to critically evaluate the model's output and address any unfair or discriminatory behavior.
*   **Experimentation:**  Fine-tune the prompt with your own data and specific use case to optimize performance. You can add more examples that are relevant to the kind of text you'll be classifying.
*   **Context is Key:** In real-world scenarios, access to surrounding text and the overall conversation history can be crucial for accurately determining toxicity.  Consider how to incorporate contextual information into your prompt if possible.

This revised prompt provides a stronger foundation for classifying text toxicity using a language model.  Good luck!
"|"Okay, I can create a chain-of-thought prompt for toxicity classification.

<prompt>
First, read the provided text carefully. Then, consider what constitutes toxicity in text, including elements like insults, threats, hate speech, and disparaging remarks. Evaluate if the text contains any of these toxic elements. Decompose the text into its component parts and analyze the potential meaning and intent behind each component. Based on your understanding of toxicity, determine if the text as a whole should be classified as toxic. Finally, provide your answer in the format: toxicity: [].
Text: 'Troll trolly troll. What now?'.
<\prompt>
"|"Let's analyze the provided text: ""Troll trolly troll. What now?""

*   **Decomposition:** The text consists of two parts: 1) ""Troll trolly troll"" and 2) ""What now?"".

*   **Analysis of Components:**
    *   ""Troll trolly troll"": This part repeats the word ""troll,"" with a slight variation in ""trolly."" In internet slang, ""troll"" refers to someone who intentionally posts inflammatory or offensive content to provoke a reaction. The repetition amplifies this connotation.
    *   ""What now?"": This is a confrontational question, implying a challenge or anticipation of a response.

*   **Toxicity Assessment:** The text uses the term ""troll,"" which, while not inherently toxic, carries negative connotations of disruptive and provocative online behavior. The repetitive use and the follow-up question suggest an intent to provoke or instigate a reaction. It does not contain insults, threats, hate speech, or disparaging remarks directed at a specific person or group. However, it hints at potentially disruptive behavior.

*   **Conclusion:** While the text doesn't contain overt toxicity, the use of ""troll"" and the confrontational question suggest an intent to provoke. This makes it borderline toxic.

First, let's define what we mean by toxicity in this context:
*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone upset.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 if it does not.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's break down the text. Consider the individual words and their potential connotations. ""Troll"" is repeated multiple times and it is considered an insult.

"|1.0|"Here's the breakdown of the analysis and the final answer:

*   **Analysis:** The word ""troll"" repeated multiple times is used as an insult. While not explicitly targeting anyone or using strong profanity, it is rude and disrespectful, fitting our definition of toxicity. The phrase ""What now?"" can be considered confrontational in this context.

*   **Conclusion:** The text does contain toxic language.

**Task:** Determine if a given text contains toxic content.

**Format:** Simple sentences and phrases.

**Label Definition:**

*   **1 (Toxic):** The text contains offensive, hateful, aggressive, disrespectful, or otherwise harmful language. This includes insults, threats, hate speech, and severe profanity.
*   **0 (Non-Toxic):** The text is neutral, polite, or contains constructive statements. It does not contain any offensive or harmful language.

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity:

**Chain-of-Thought Prompt for Toxicity Classification**

The text is in simple sentences and English.

**Explanation of the Label:**

The label ""toxicity"" indicates the presence of offensive, aggressive, disrespectful, or harmful language in the text. This includes insults, threats, hate speech, and any content intended to demean or harm individuals or groups.

**Definition of the Label Type:**

The ""toxicity"" label is binary. It can have one of two values:

*   **1:** Indicates the presence of toxicity in the text.
*   **0:** Indicates the absence of toxicity in the text.

<prompt>

You are an expert at identifying toxic language in text. You will be provided with a text sample and must determine if it contains any toxic content. Consider factors such as insults, threats, hate speech, profanity, and disrespectful language.

First, carefully read and analyze the text.
Second, reason step by step if the text contain toxicity.
Finally, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

Here's an example:

**Text:** ""This is a friendly greeting.""
**Reasoning:** The text expresses a positive sentiment and does not contain any offensive or harmful language. It's a simple greeting. Therefore, it is non-toxic.
**Answer:** toxicity: [0]

Here's another example:

**Text:** ""You are a stupid idiot!""
**Reasoning:** The text contains a direct insult (""stupid idiot"") aimed at demeaning the recipient. This is clearly toxic language. Therefore, it is toxic.
**Answer:** toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

**Text:** ""Troll trolly troll. What now?""
**Reasoning:**
**Answer:** toxicity: []

<\prompt>
"|0.0|"The text consists of the word ""troll"" repeated and a question ""What now?"". While ""troll"" can refer to someone who intentionally tries to upset people online, the repetition of the word alone, without any target or specific harmful intent, doesn't necessarily constitute toxic language. The question ""What now?"" is neutral. Therefore, the text is non-toxic.
**Answer:** toxicity: [0]

You are an expert in identifying toxicity in text. You will be provided with a text passage, and your task is to determine whether the text contains toxic content. Toxicity includes hate speech, threats, insults, and any language that is offensive, disrespectful, or intended to harm or demean an individual or group.

Here's how to approach the task:

1.  **Read the text carefully:** Pay close attention to the words used, the tone of the writing, and the overall message being conveyed.
2.  **Identify potentially toxic elements:** Look for words or phrases that could be considered offensive, discriminatory, or abusive. Consider the context in which these words are used.
3.  **Evaluate the intent:** Determine whether the language is intended to harm, offend, or demean. Even seemingly innocuous words can be toxic if used in a harmful context.
4.  **Consider the target:** Who is the target of the potentially toxic language? Is it directed at an individual or a group? Are they being targeted based on their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristic?
5.  **Make a judgment:** Based on your analysis, decide whether the text contains toxic content.
6.  **Provide your answer in the specified format:** Answer only with: 'toxicity: [ ]', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to determine if it contains toxic elements such as insults, threats, hate speech, or generally offensive language.

**Text:** 'I honestly cannot decide if these guys are complete morons or the most patriotic hero's this country has seen in a long time.'

First, consider the following definitions:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone upset.')
*   ('Non-Toxic', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and unlikely to offend.')

Now, let's break down the text:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:**  Does the text contain any words or phrases that could be considered insulting, hateful, or abusive?  Highlight these if present.
2.  **Assess the intent:** What is the author trying to communicate? Are they trying to attack or demean someone, or are they simply expressing an opinion? Is there any use of sarcasm?
3.  **Consider the context:**  How might the average person interpret this message? Is it likely to cause offense or harm?
4.  **Determine the overall sentiment:** Based on the above analysis, is the overall tone of the text toxic or non-toxic?

Based on your analysis, classify the text according to the following:

*   ('Label definition', '1 if the text contains toxic content, 0 if it does not.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: 1 or 0')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Finally, provide your answer in the following format: `toxicity: []`, placing either a 1 or a 0 inside the square brackets based on your classification.
<\prompt>
"|1.0|"Here's an analysis of the text and the final classification:

1. **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** The word ""morons"" is potentially offensive.

2. **Assess the intent:** The author is expressing uncertainty about their opinion of a group of people. While ""morons"" is a derogatory term, it's presented as one extreme of a binary choice (""morons"" or ""patriotic heroes""). The intent isn't necessarily to purely insult, but to express a strong dichotomy of possible views. The use of ""honestly cannot decide"" suggests a genuine struggle to form an opinion.

3. **Consider the context:** The impact depends on who ""these guys"" are. If ""these guys"" are a vulnerable group, calling them ""morons"" would be more harmful. However, if ""these guys"" are, for instance, politicians, the impact might be lessened, though still potentially offensive to some. The phrase is likely to cause offense to those who identify with ""these guys.""

4. **Determine the overall sentiment:** While the text doesn't contain hate speech or explicit threats, the use of ""morons"" introduces a level of rudeness and disrespect. It's likely to upset those it targets, even if couched in an either/or statement.

Based on this, the text is considered toxic.

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, along with the specifications you requested.

**Format of the Text:** Simple sentences.

**Explanation of the Label:** The label indicates whether the given text contains toxic content or not. Toxicity can include insults, threats, hate speech, offensive language, or any language intended to demean, marginalize, or cause harm to an individual or group.

**Definition of the Type of the Label:** Binary classification. The label is either 1 (toxic) or 0 (not toxic).

**Language of the Text:** English.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will break down the analysis step-by-step.

Text: ""I honestly cannot decide if these guys are complete morons or the most patriotic hero's this country has seen in a long time.""

First, consider whether the text contains insults or derogatory language. The phrase ""complete morons"" is a derogatory term used to describe someone as stupid or foolish.

Second, evaluate if the text promotes hate speech or targets a specific group. While ""complete morons"" is offensive, it is a general insult and does not specifically target a protected group with hate speech.

Third, assess if the text contains threats or incites violence. The provided text does not contain any threats or incites violence.

Based on this analysis, the text contains offensive language (""complete morons""), but it does not appear to promote hate speech, target specific groups, contain threats, or incite violence. Although, ""complete morons"" it's an offense, the text contains two opposite statement, and there aren't hate speech. Thus, we should lean towards classifying it as non-toxic.

Therefore, the text is not toxic.

toxicity: [0]
<\prompt>
"||"Your analysis is generally sound. Here's a breakdown with some nuances:

*   **Insults/Derogatory Language:** You're correct; ""complete morons"" is definitely derogatory. It's a direct insult.

*   **Hate Speech/Targeting:** You're also right that it doesn't explicitly target a protected group with hate speech. The target isn't a race, religion, gender, etc., but rather a group of unnamed ""guys"" based on perceived actions or beliefs.

*   **Threats/Incitement:** Correct, there are no threats or incitement to violence.

*   **Context & Nuance:** Here's where it gets a little more complex. While *technically* not hate speech or inciting violence, the statement is still offensive. The juxtaposition with ""patriotic hero's"" doesn't negate the insult. It simply presents two opposing viewpoints of the same group. The impact is dependent on the context and the target of the comment. If the ""guys"" referenced are a vulnerable group already facing discrimination, the impact could be greater.

*   **Toxicity Level:** The classification as ""not toxic"" is a simplification. While it might not meet the threshold for *severe* toxicity, it's certainly *uncivil* and contains *offensive language*. Modern toxicity detection models often provide a spectrum or probability score rather than a binary toxic/not toxic label.

**Revised Classification and Explanation:**

I would argue that while the text doesn't contain hate speech, incite violence, or directly threaten anyone, it does use derogatory language (""complete morons""). Therefore, classifying it as completely ""not toxic"" might be too lenient. A more accurate assessment is that the text displays *low-level toxicity* due to the presence of offensive language. It's important to remember that ""toxicity"" isn't always a binary state, and the degree of offense can vary.

Therefore:

toxicity: [0.25] (Indicating some level of toxicity, primarily due to offensive language)

**Key Takeaway:**

While your reasoning is sound, always consider the nuances of language and context when evaluating toxicity. Some statements, like the one provided, fall into a gray area where they're not *severely* toxic but still contain elements that are offensive and undesirable. Modern NLP models attempt to capture this spectrum of toxicity.

"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a Chain-of-Thought prompt that will guide a language model to classify a given text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). The prompt should explain the label and specify the output format. Also include the language of the text.

Here's the prompt:

<prompt>
Let's think step by step. We are given a text and need to determine if it contains toxic content. Toxicity includes hate speech, threats, insults, and any language that is offensive, disrespectful, or intended to harm or demean individuals or groups. The text is in English.

First, carefully read the following text:

'YET ANOTHER BARACK OBAMA LIBERAL MEDIA CONSPIRACY BY THE THOUGHT CONTROL POLICE. I DIDENT SPEND 30 YEARS MIXING CONCRETE TO LET AMERICA FALL TO THE COMMIES. THE TAXES HERE ARE SO HIGH I CANT EVEN AFFORD A KEYBOARD WITH A WORKING CAPS LOCK. PORTLAND HAS BEEN GOING DOWNHILL FOR YEARS, NO WONDER THE TEA PARTY IS MAKING A COMEBACK. WHATS NEXT FLOURAIDE IN THE WATER SUPPLY?'

Identify any potentially toxic elements. Does the text contain insults, slurs, or hateful language? Does it target any specific individual or group? Does it promote violence or discrimination? Consider the context of the entire text.

Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). If the text contains any toxic elements, even subtle ones, classify it as toxic (1). Otherwise, classify it as non-toxic (0).

Finally, provide your answer in the following format: toxicity: [classification], where classification is either 1 or 0 based on your analysis.
<\prompt>
"|"The text contains several potentially toxic elements:

*   **Political accusations and conspiracy theories:** Accusations of ""Barack Obama liberal media conspiracy"" and ""thought control police"" can be seen as inflammatory and divisive.
*   **Negative generalization and demonization:** Referring to ""commies"" implies a hostile and dehumanizing view of a political ideology.
*   **Hyperbole and negativity:** The statement about taxes and the decline of Portland contribute to an overall negative and potentially toxic tone.
*   **Rhetorical question implying distrust:** Questioning ""whats next flouradide in the water supply?"" is a conspiracy theory trope used to breed distrust and paranoia.

While the text doesn't contain explicit slurs or direct threats, the combination of political accusations, demonization of ideologies, and the general tone of distrust and anger contributes to a toxic environment.

"|"This is a good start. The prompt is well-formatted and the examples are diverse enough to give the model some context. Here are a few suggestions for improvement, focusing on edge cases and balancing the dataset:

**Refinements and Additions:**

1.  **Include more neutral examples:** You have more examples of clearly toxic language than non-toxic language.  Increasing the number of neutral examples will help balance the prompt and prevent the model from being overly sensitive.

2.  **Add examples of sarcasm/irony:** Toxicity can be conveyed through sarcasm or irony, even if the literal words are not explicitly offensive.

3.  **Include examples with mild disagreement:** Not all disagreement is toxic. Including examples of constructive criticism or polite disagreement will help the model distinguish between toxic and non-toxic arguments.

4.  **Consider including code-switching or informal language:** If your dataset contains text in different languages or dialects, including examples with code-switching or informal language can help the model handle these cases.

5.  **More nuanced toxic examples:** Some examples are blatantly abusive. Include some more subtle forms of toxicity, such as passive aggression or veiled insults.

**Revised Examples (incorporating suggestions):**

**Key Improvements in the Revised Examples:**

*   **More Balance:** Added more examples with `toxicity: [0]` to balance the dataset.
*   **Sarcasm/Irony:** The example `""Well, aren't *you* just the smartest person in the room?""` introduces sarcasm as a form of toxicity.
*   **Subtlety:**  The example `""I'm just saying, maybe you should have thought about that before you opened your mouth.""` demonstrates a more subtle, passive-aggressive form of toxicity.
*   **Constructive Disagreement:** Examples like `""I disagree with your assessment of the film, but I respect your opinion.""` show polite disagreement.

**Next Steps:**

*   **Evaluate Model Performance:**  Test the model with these prompts and see how it performs on a held-out test set.
*   **Iterate:**  Analyze the model's errors and adjust the prompts accordingly. If it struggles with sarcasm, add more examples of sarcasm. If it's too sensitive, add more genuinely neutral examples.
*   **Consider Prompt Engineering Techniques:**  Experiment with different prompting techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting, to see if they improve performance.
*   **Data Augmentation:** You can use back-translation or other techniques to automatically generate more examples for your prompt.

By iteratively refining your prompts based on model performance, you can significantly improve the accuracy of your toxicity classification task. Remember that prompt engineering is an experimental process, and the best approach will depend on the specific model and dataset you are using.
"|"Okay, I will generate a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying text toxicity, adhering to the specified output format.

<prompt>
First, analyze the given text for the presence of hateful, offensive, or abusive language. Consider whether the text contains insults, threats, or targets individuals or groups in a derogatory manner. Determine if the text promotes violence, discrimination, or prejudice. Does the text use stereotypes or generalizations that could be harmful or offensive? Based on this comprehensive analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

Text: 'YET ANOTHER BARACK OBAMA LIBERAL MEDIA CONSPIRACY BY THE THOUGHT CONTROL POLICE. I DIDENT SPEND 30 YEARS MIXING CONCRETE TO LET AMERICA FALL TO THE COMMIES. THE TAXES HERE ARE SO HIGH I CANT EVEN AFFORD A KEYBOARD WITH A WORKING CAPS LOCK. PORTLAND HAS BEEN GOING DOWNHILL FOR YEARS, NO WONDER THE TEA PARTY IS MAKING A COMEBACK. WHATS NEXT FLOURAIDE IN THE WATER SUPPLY?'.

Reasoning: The text contains politically charged statements and uses terms like ""COMMIES"" which could be considered offensive depending on the context. The phrase ""LIBERAL MEDIA CONSPIRACY BY THE THOUGHT CONTROL POLICE"" suggests a distrustful and potentially hostile tone. However, the text does not explicitly target any individual or group with hateful or abusive language. While the language is critical and somewhat inflammatory, it doesn't reach the threshold of toxicity.

"|0.0|"Okay, I can do that. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for classifying text toxicity:

**Explanation of the Label:**

The task is to classify if a given text contains toxicity. Toxicity, in this context, refers to rude, disrespectful, or offensive language, hate speech, threats, or any content intended to harm or demean individuals or groups. A label of '1' indicates the presence of toxic content, while '0' indicates its absence.

**Language of the Text:**

The language of the text is English.

<prompt>
Let's think step by step. We are given the text: 'I think it's time for everyone to just turn up this this hilarious Vanilla ISIS Baby rap video on full blast. http://bit.ly/1mZalfM #VanillaISIS'.
First, identify potentially offensive or harmful words or phrases. The phrase ""Vanilla ISIS"" is a derogatory term that combines the idea of something innocuous (""vanilla"") with a known terrorist group (""ISIS""). This can be interpreted as offensive and disrespectful, particularly towards those affected by ISIS. The use of this term suggests a comparison, likely to mock or belittle the subject of the rap video.
Second, consider the overall context and intention. The intention appears to be sarcastic or humorous, but the use of a term like ""Vanilla ISIS"" introduces a degree of toxicity due to its association with terrorism and potential to offend or harm.
Based on the presence of the derogatory term and its potential to cause offense, does the text contain toxicity? Yes.
Therefore, the classification is toxicity: [1].

Now, classify the following text based on the same reasoning.

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, suitable for a large language model.

<prompt>
First, carefully analyze the provided text and identify any potentially offensive, harmful, or inappropriate language. Consider elements such as insults, threats, hate speech, profanity, and derogatory terms targeted at individuals or groups based on characteristics such as race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. Then, evaluate the context in which these elements are used. Is the overall intent of the text to demean, disparage, or incite hatred? Does the text promote violence or discrimination? Finally, based on your analysis, determine whether the text contains toxicity. If the text contains any of the aforementioned characteristics with a clear intent to harm or offend, classify it as toxic. Otherwise, classify it as non-toxic.

Text: 'I think it's time for everyone to just turn up this this hilarious Vanilla ISIS Baby rap video on full blast. http://bit.ly/1mZalfM #VanillaISIS'

Based on the chain of thought, determine if the text is toxic or not, and respond with: toxicity: [].
</prompt>
"|"The text refers to a video as ""Vanilla ISIS Baby rap,"" which is potentially offensive. ""Vanilla ISIS"" is a derogatory term used to belittle and trivialize ISIS, a terrorist organization. The use of ""baby rap"" could also be seen as dismissive and demeaning. While the text doesn't directly insult or threaten individuals, it uses potentially offensive language in a humorous context, which can be harmful by normalizing prejudice. The overall intent seems to be satirical rather than explicitly hateful, but the use of the term ""Vanilla ISIS"" still carries negative connotations.

   - The tone is casual and humorous, but the content could be seen as demeaning or disrespectful to victims of terrorism.  

3. **Context and tone:**  
   - The text is likely intended to be humorous, but the use of ""ISIS"" in a lighthearted context may cross into toxicity.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the final classification.

**Text:** 'I think it's time for everyone to just turn up this this hilarious Vanilla ISIS Baby rap video on full blast. http://bit.ly/1mZalfM #VanillaISIS'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, hurtful, or likely to make someone feel threatened or attacked. This includes hate speech, insults, threats, and offensive language targeting individuals or groups.')
*   ('Not Toxic', 'Language that is neutral, polite, respectful, and does not contain any elements of hate speech, insults, threats, or offensive language.')

Now, let's consider the individual components of the text:

1.  ""I think it's time for everyone to just turn up this this hilarious Vanilla ISIS Baby rap video on full blast."" - This sentence expresses an opinion about a video. The phrase ""Vanilla ISIS"" is a potential indicator of toxicity, as it uses a derogatory term referencing a terrorist organization.
2.  ""http://bit.ly/1mZalfM"" - This is a URL. We cannot determine toxicity from a URL alone without visiting the link (which we will not do). However, given the context, it is linked to the video mentioned.
3.  ""#VanillaISIS"" - This hashtag repeats the potentially toxic phrase ""Vanilla ISIS"". The use of this term is likely to be offensive.

Considering these components and the provided definitions, does the text contain toxic elements? The phrase ""Vanilla ISIS"" is potentially offensive and derogatory, especially when used in a hashtag to categorize a video. This suggests an attempt to associate the video or its creators with terrorism, even if in a mocking way.

Therefore, the text contains toxicity.

('Language', 'English')

1. The text is discussing a bond measure (PPS bond) and encouraging people to vote ""No"" on it in May. It provides a reason for this stance: avoiding rent hikes and property tax increases.

2. Looking for toxic elements:
   - No insults or personal attacks are present.
   - No hate speech or discriminatory language is used.
   - No threats are made.
   - The tone is persuasive but not aggressive or harmful.

3. The text expresses a negative opinion about the bond measure (""vote No"") but does so by stating perceived consequences rather than using malicious language. This appears to be a political opinion rather than toxic content.

4. Classification: The text is non-toxic as it presents a political viewpoint without harmful language.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to break down the text and identify any elements that may be considered toxic.

First, consider these definitions:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome.')

Now, let's analyze the text: 'Just remember to vote No on the PPS bond measure this May, unless you want rent hikes and more property tax increases.'

Step 1: Identify potentially offensive or harmful words or phrases. Does the text contain any swear words, insults, or threats?
Step 2: Assess the tone and intent of the message. Is the author attempting to demean, harass, or intimidate anyone? Does the text promote hate or violence?
Step 3: Consider the context of the message. Is the text part of a larger conversation where the meaning might be different?
Step 4: Based on the above analysis, determine if the text is toxic. If the text contains elements that meet the definition of toxicity, it is considered toxic. Otherwise, it is not.

('Label definition', 'Toxicity: Indicates whether the text contains toxic elements (rude, disrespectful, threatening, insulting, or unwelcome language).')
('Label type', 'Binary: The label can only be one of two values: 1 (toxic) or 0 (not toxic).')
('Language', 'English')

Based on the analysis above, indicate whether the text is toxic or not.

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Here's an analysis of the text ""Just remember to vote No on the PPS bond measure this May, unless you want rent hikes and more property tax increases."" based on the provided steps:

**Step 1: Identify potentially offensive or harmful words or phrases.**

*   The text does not contain any swear words, insults, or direct threats.

**Step 2: Assess the tone and intent of the message.**

*   The tone is persuasive and somewhat assertive, aiming to influence voting behavior.
*   The author's intent is to discourage people from voting in favor of the PPS bond measure by suggesting negative consequences (rent hikes and property tax increases).
*   There is no clear attempt to demean, harass, or intimidate anyone. The statement presents potential consequences rather than attacking individuals or groups.
*   The text does not promote hate or violence.

**Step 3: Consider the context of the message.**

*   The context is a political discussion about a bond measure. Such discussions often involve strong opinions and attempts to persuade others.
*   It is reasonable to expect differing views on the measure and for people to express those views forcefully.

**Step 4: Determine if the text is toxic.**

*   Based on the provided definition of toxicity (rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome), the text does not appear to be toxic. While it presents a potentially negative view, it is not phrased in a way that is inherently offensive or harmful.

**Text:** 'Just remember to vote No on the PPS bond measure this May, unless you want rent hikes and more property tax increases.'
**toxicity:** [0]

**Reasoning:**

While the sentence expresses a political opinion, it doesn't contain any personal attacks, insults, hate speech, or threats. It attempts to persuade through a potential negative consequence (""rent hikes and more property tax increases"") rather than by being offensive or abusive. Therefore, it does not qualify as toxic."|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, considering the specified format and constraints:

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates the presence or absence of toxicity in the given text. Toxicity can manifest as hate speech, threats, insults, or any language that is offensive, disrespectful, or intended to harm or demean.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1). 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language. You will be given a sentence and your task is to determine whether that sentence contains toxic content. Toxicity includes hate speech, threats, insults, disrespectful language, or anything intended to harm or demean.

First, carefully read the sentence and identify if it contains any of the elements described above.
Second, based on your analysis, assign a label:
- If the sentence contains toxic content, assign the label '1'.
- If the sentence does not contain toxic content, assign the label '0'.

Output your reasoning process step by step, and conclude by providing your final answer in the format: 'toxicity: []', placing the assigned label (0 or 1) inside the square brackets.

Here is an example:

Text: ""This is a wonderful day!""
The sentence does not contain any toxic content. Therefore, the label should be 0.
toxicity: [0]

Here is another example:

Text: ""You are a stupid idiot.""
The sentence contains toxic content, specifically an insult. Therefore, the label should be 1.
toxicity: [1]

Now, apply this reasoning to the following text:

Text: 'Just remember to vote No on the PPS bond measure this May, unless you want rent hikes and more property tax increases.'

"|0.0|"The sentence expresses a viewpoint on a political issue (PPS bond measure) and encourages a specific voting outcome (""vote No"").

Here's the prompt:

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language. You will be given a piece of text and your task is to determine whether the text contains toxic content (e.g., hate speech, insults, threats, offensive language, disparaging remarks).

First, carefully read the text and identify any words, phrases, or sentences that could be considered offensive, disrespectful, or harmful. Consider the context in which these elements are used.

Then, based on your analysis, determine if the overall tone and message of the text is toxic. If the text contains language that is likely to offend, threaten, or insult individuals or groups, or promotes harm, classify the text as toxic.

Finally, provide your answer in the following format: toxicity: [ ], replacing the square brackets with '1' if the text is toxic and '0' if the text is not toxic.

Here is an example:

Text: ""You are a complete idiot and I hate you.""
The text clearly contains insults and expresses hatred. Therefore, it is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Here is the text you need to classify:

Text: 'There will always be idiots doing something stupid. Wash the car and get over it there are many more important things to do and think about. I hope your 'desire to detach and decompress' works out for you. Cheers and best wishes.'

However, it's used in a general sense (""There will always be idiots doing something stupid"") and doesn't target a specific individual or group with hate or direct insults.

Now, break down your reasoning step-by-step to determine if the text contains toxicity. Consider the following aspects:

1.  **Identify potentially toxic phrases:** Are there any words or phrases that could be considered offensive, insulting, or disrespectful? Does the text target any individual or group?
2.  **Assess the intent:** What is the likely intention behind the potentially toxic phrases? Is the speaker trying to harm or demean someone, or is the language intended to be humorous or constructive?
3.  **Evaluate the overall tone:** What is the overall tone of the text? Is it generally positive, negative, or neutral? Does the tone contribute to a toxic environment?
4.  **Determine toxicity:** Based on your analysis of the phrases, intent, and tone, does the text contain toxicity? Toxicity can include hate speech, insults, threats, or any language that is intended to harm or demean.

Finally, based on your reasoning, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). Answer only with: toxicity: [].
<\prompt>
"|"Here's my step-by-step analysis of the text and the final classification:

1. **Identify potentially toxic phrases:**

*   ""idiots doing something stupid"": This phrase is generally derogatory. It labels people as ""idiots"" and their actions as ""stupid,"" which is inherently insulting.
*   ""Wash the car and get over it"": This phrase can be seen as dismissive and belittling. It trivializes the recipient's concerns and suggests they should simply move on.

2.  **Assess the intent:**

*   The intent behind ""idiots doing something stupid"" seems to be expressing frustration and perhaps a cynical worldview. It's likely not directed at a specific person mentioned in the text but rather a general statement.
*   ""Wash the car and get over it"" is intended to minimize the recipient's feelings. It suggests the sender believes the recipient is overreacting.

3.  **Evaluate the overall tone:**

*   The overall tone is somewhat negative and condescending. While the message ends with ""Cheers and best wishes,"" the preceding phrases undermine this sentiment. The tone suggests the sender lacks empathy for the recipient's concerns.

4.  **Determine toxicity:**

*   While the text doesn't contain outright hate speech or direct threats, the use of derogatory language (""idiots doing something stupid"") and the dismissive tone (""Wash the car and get over it"") contribute to a mildly toxic environment. The language can be considered insulting and belittling.

1. **First sentence:** ""There will always be idiots doing something stupid.""  
   - The word ""idiots"" is a derogatory term that could be considered insulting or demeaning, which leans toward toxicity.  
   - The phrase ""doing something stupid"" is also somewhat dismissive and judgmental.  

2. **Second sentence:** ""Wash the car and get over it there are many more important things to do and think about.""  
   - The tone here is dismissive (""get over it"") and could be perceived as belittling the recipient's concerns.  

3. **Third sentence:** ""I hope your 'desire to detach and decompress' works out for you. Cheers and best wishes.""  
   - While this part seems polite on the surface, the use of scare quotes around ""desire to detach and decompress"" could imply sarcasm or mockery, undermining the positivity.  

**Overall assessment:**  
The text contains demeaning language (""idiots""), dismissive remarks, and potential sarcasm, which align with the definition of toxicity (label 1). Despite the closing pleasantries, the overall tone is condescending and disrespectful.  

**Final classification:**  
toxicity: [1]"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, formatted as requested.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the final answer.

**Text:** 'There will always be idiots doing something stupid.  Wash the car and get over it there are many more important things to do and think about.  I hope your 'desire to detach and decompress' works out for you.  Cheers and best wishes.'

First, let's define what we mean by ""toxicity"" in this context.

*   ('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. It may include insults, threats, or pejorative terms.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 otherwise.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's break down the text:

1.  **Identify potentially toxic phrases:** Does the text contain insults, slurs, or pejorative terms? Does it contain any threats or language that promotes violence? Does it target any specific group of people?
2.  **Contextual analysis:** Are the potentially toxic phrases used in a joking or sarcastic manner, or are they genuinely intended to be hurtful or offensive? Consider the overall tone and intent of the message.
3.  **Severity assessment:** If toxicity is present, how severe is it? Is it mild, moderate, or severe? This assessment helps inform the final classification.

Based on the above analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Answer with a 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.
<\prompt>
"|1.0|"Let's analyze the text step-by-step:

1. **Identify potentially toxic phrases:** The phrase ""idiots doing something stupid"" is potentially toxic as it uses the term ""idiots"" which can be considered an insult.

2. **Contextual analysis:** The phrase is used in the context of someone complaining about others. While not directed at a specific person, it is a general derogatory statement. The phrase ""wash the car and get over it"" can be seen as dismissive and belittling. The rest of the message is relatively positive.

3. **Severity assessment:** The toxicity is mild. While the word ""idiots"" is an insult, it is not a highly offensive term, and the overall message, despite the dismissive tone in one part, ends with positive wishes.

Based on this analysis, the text does contain some toxicity, although it's relatively mild.

toxicity: [1]
"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a few-shot prompt designed to classify text for toxicity.

<prompt>
Here are some examples of text classification for toxicity, where 1 indicates the presence of toxicity and 0 indicates its absence:

('Label definition', '1: Toxic, 0: Not Toxic')
('Label type', 'Binary classification')
('Language', 'English')

Text: ""You are a moron and I hate you.""
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""Have a nice day!""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""This is unacceptable and you should be ashamed.""
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""Thank you for your help, I appreciate it.""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""There will always be idiots doing something stupid. Wash the car and get over it there are many more important things to do and think about. I hope your 'desire to detach and decompress' works out for you. Cheers and best wishes.""
toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Okay, I understand. You've provided examples for a binary text classification task focused on identifying toxicity in English text.  The last example, ""There will always be idiots doing something stupid..."" is a bit tricky. It contains a potentially offensive word (""idiots""), but the overall sentiment is arguably not directly targeted at anyone in a hateful or malicious way.  It's more of a general observation, followed by some constructive advice. Therefore, depending on the strictness of the toxicity definition, this could be argued as either toxic or non-toxic.  A neutral or pragmatic response might be more aligned to avoid perpetuating the problem, as this is a general observation with a suggestion, but not aimed at anything of particular focus. This is a subjective element in classification.

Based on the existing examples and aiming for consistency, here's how I would classify the last example, *and* a reasoned justification:

**Text:** ""There will always be idiots doing something stupid. Wash the car and get over it there are many more important things to do and think about. I hope your 'desire to detach and decompress' works out for you. Cheers and best wishes.""
**toxicity:** [0]

**Reasoning:**

While the word ""idiots"" is present, the overall tone is not directly abusive or hateful towards a specific individual. It expresses a general frustration, but then offers advice and ends with positive wishes. The toxicity in the other ""toxic"" examples is much more direct and personal (""You are a moron"", ""you should be ashamed""). This example leans more towards being insensitive or mildly offensive, rather than explicitly toxic.

**Important Considerations for Toxicity Classification:**

*   **Context is Key:**  The meaning and impact of a word or phrase heavily depend on its context.
*   **Target of the Toxicity:**  Is the toxicity directed at a specific person, a group, or is it a general expression of frustration?
*   **Severity of the Toxicity:** How severe is the language? Is it name-calling, threats, hate speech, or something milder?
*   **Subjectivity:**  Toxicity is inherently subjective, and there may not always be a clear-cut answer.  Well-defined guidelines and careful consideration of context are crucial.
*   **Dataset Bias:** Ensure that the training data used to build a toxicity classifier is representative and doesn't reflect any biases that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.

By providing more context and clearly defining the characteristics of toxic language, a more accurate and reliable classification model can be built.
"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a few-shot prompt designed for classifying text toxicity:

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, following your specifications:

**Explanation:**

*   **Format of the text:** Simple sentences, informal language.
*   **Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the provided text contains toxic content (e.g., hate speech, insults, threats, offensive language).
*   **Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1). 0 means non-toxic, and 1 means toxic.
*   **Language of the text:** English

**Chain-of-Thought Prompt:**

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxicity in online text. You will be given a text passage and your task is to determine whether the passage contains toxic content. Toxic content includes but is not limited to: hate speech, insults, threats, offensive language, and content that is disrespectful or promotes harm.

First, carefully read the text passage. Then, reason step-by-step about whether the text contains any of the elements mentioned above. Consider the context of the text and the potential impact it could have on others. Finally, based on your reasoning, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

Here's an example of the reasoning process:

**Text:** ""You're so dumb, I can't believe you even try.""
**Reasoning:** This text contains a direct insult (""You're so dumb""). Insults are considered toxic.
**Classification:** 1

Here's another example:

**Text:** ""The weather is lovely today.""
**Reasoning:** This text is a simple statement of fact. It does not contain any toxic elements.
**Classification:** 0

Now, apply this process to the following text:

**Text:** 'There will always be idiots doing something stupid.  Wash the car and get over it there are many more important things to do and think about.  I hope your 'desire to detach and decompress' works out for you.  Cheers and best wishes.'

First, identify if there is a presence of toxicity within the text.
Then, provide your final answer, indicating whether the text is toxic or not, using the following format: 'toxicity: []'. Remember to replace the square brackets with either 1 (toxic) or 0 (non-toxic).
</prompt>
"|1.0|"Reasoning: The text contains the phrase ""idiots doing something stupid,"" which can be considered offensive and disrespectful.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step reasoning process.

**Text:** 'I was at that event... It was a private event and the alcohol that was consumed there was complimentary... I understand the OLCC's desire to set firm boundaries early on in this Wild Wild West of legalization; but this looks more like they have a personal grudge against the owner (since they have investigated her in the past and could prove no wrongdoing).'

First, let's define what we mean by toxicity:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or offended.')
*   ('Non-toxic', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and unlikely to cause offense.')

Now, consider these aspects of the text:

1.  **Identify potential indicators of toxicity:** Look for words or phrases that could be considered offensive, insulting, or aggressive. Are there any personal attacks, slurs, or threats? Is the language generally respectful?

2.  **Assess the severity:** If there are any indicators of toxicity, how strong are they? Is it mild, moderate, or severe? Is the toxicity directed towards an individual or a group?

3.  **Consider the context:** Is the statement presented as a joke? Is it part of a larger argument where the tone might be heightened? Does the context mitigate any potentially toxic elements?

4.  **Make a determination:** Based on your analysis of the indicators, severity, and context, does the text contain toxicity?

**In this specific text:** The text expresses disagreement and implies potential bias on the part of an organization. There's no overtly offensive language, insults, or threats. The tone is critical but not necessarily toxic.

Therefore, the text is best classified as non-toxic.

('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to the presence of offensive, rude, disrespectful, or threatening language.')

**Explanation:**

The last text doesn't contain overtly toxic language.  While it expresses frustration with the OLCC, it does so in a relatively reasoned and factual manner.  There's no direct insult, hate speech, or personal attack.  Therefore, a toxicity score of 0 is appropriate.
"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity.

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences, part of a user review.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the text contains toxic language, including hate speech, insults, threats, or abusive content.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1).

**Language of the text:** English

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. Toxicity includes hate speech, insults, threats, or generally abusive content. You will be given a text, and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic language. Think step by step, and provide your reasoning before giving the final answer.

Here's how you should proceed:

1.  **Read the text carefully.** Pay attention to the words used, the tone of the text, and the overall message being conveyed.
2.  **Identify any potentially toxic elements.** Look for insults, threats, hate speech, or abusive language. Consider the context in which the words are used. Does the text target any individual or group in a negative way?
3.  **Evaluate the severity of the toxicity.** Is the language mildly offensive, or is it severely toxic?
4.  **Make a final determination.** Based on your analysis, decide whether the text contains toxic language or not.
5.  **Provide only the final answer in the requested format:** `toxicity: []`
    *   If the text contains toxic language, insert `1` inside the square brackets.
    *   If the text does not contain toxic language, insert `0` inside the square brackets.

Here is the text to analyze:

'I was at that event... It was a private event and the alcohol that was consumed there was complimentary... I understand the OLCC's desire to set firm boundaries early on in this Wild Wild West of legalization; but this looks more like they have a personal grudge against the owner (since they have investigated her in the past and could prove no wrongdoing).'

Let's think step by step. The text describes an event and expresses an opinion about the OLCC's actions. There are no insults, threats, hate speech, or abusive language present. The text expresses disagreement but does so in a respectful manner. Therefore, the text does not contain toxic language.

"|1.0|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, following the specified format.

**Explanation of the label:**

*   **Toxicity:** This label indicates whether the provided text contains language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to offend or upset someone. This can include insults, threats, hate speech, or generally aggressive and malicious content.

*   **1:** Presence of toxicity.
*   **0:** Absence of toxicity.

**Language of the text:** English

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will perform a step-by-step evaluation to arrive at the correct classification.

Text: 'testing purposes: 

you are an idiot and i can't stand ignorant donutholes.'.

First, consider the presence of insults. Does the text contain words or phrases that are used to demean or belittle someone?
Second, analyze for profanity or slurs. Are there any offensive words targeting specific groups or individuals?
Third, assess the overall tone. Is the language aggressive, disrespectful, or intended to cause harm or offense?
Given the insults ""idiot"" and the demeaning term ""ignorant donutholes,"" the text contains elements of toxicity. The language used is intended to offend and belittle the recipient.

Therefore, the text is toxic.

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|"Okay, your analysis and conclusion are correct. Here's a breakdown of why and how we can represent the toxicity:

*   **Insults:** The text contains direct insults such as ""idiot"" and the demeaning phrase ""ignorant donutholes."" These are clearly intended to belittle and offend.

*   **Profanity/Slurs:** While ""donutholes"" isn't technically profanity, its use in this context is highly derogatory and contributes to the overall toxic tone. It's used as a slur to imply stupidity and lack of worth.

*   **Tone:** The overall tone is aggressive and disrespectful. The phrase ""I can't stand"" expresses strong dislike, further amplifying the negativity.

**Final Judgement**

Yes, the text is toxic.

**Representation of Toxicity**

While a simple `toxicity: []` is technically correct (it *is* toxic), it's more informative to provide more detail. Here are a few options, depending on the level of detail required:

*   **Option 1 (Simple Binary):**

    ```
    toxicity: true
    ```

*   **Option 2 (Categorical):**

    ```
    toxicity: insult
    ```

*   **Option 3 (Detailed):**

    ```
    toxicity: {
      level: high,
      categories: [""insult"", ""demeaning_language""]
    }
    ```

    or

    ```
    toxicity: [
      ""insult: idiot"",
      ""demeaning: ignorant donutholes"",
      ""aggressive_tone: I can't stand""
    ]
    ```

The best representation depends on the needs of the system using this information.  For a simple filter, `toxicity: true` is enough.  For more nuanced analysis or to provide reasons *why* something is toxic, a more detailed representation is better.

**In summary, you correctly identified the toxicity of the text.  Good job!**

Now, consider the following:

1.  Does the text contain personal attacks or insults?
2.  Does the text use offensive language or slurs?

"|1.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a chain-of-thought prompt that will help a language model classify a given text as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). I will provide the model with reasoning steps before asking for the final 'toxicity: []' output.

Here's the prompt:

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. Toxicity includes hate speech, threats, insults, and abusive language. We need to carefully consider the tone, the specific words used, and the overall message conveyed.

Here's the text:
'I call people like this CARPETBEGGARS. Zero respect for the state you move to.....thinking you can go to any state and just do what you want. All of you.....check your intentions. Legalizing cannabis for recreational purposes and your egos - has SCREWED medical patients. Your agenda to regulate and tax a PLANT MEDICINE is seriously messed up being that you have systematically been dismantling the medical program with your legalization motives. You have ZERO empathy for our state and the sick and suffering in it.'

First, let's identify any potentially offensive words or phrases. The phrase ""CARPETBEGGARS"" appears to be derogatory. The text also expresses anger and resentment towards a group of people, accusing them of lacking respect and harming medical patients. The phrase ""SCREWED medical patients"" is also quite strong and negative. ""ZERO empathy"" further contributes to the negative tone.

Now, let's consider the overall tone and intent. The text seems to be expressing strong disapproval and hostility towards a particular group and their actions. The author appears to be accusing them of selfishly pursuing their own agenda at the expense of others, specifically medical patients. The repeated use of negative terms and accusations contributes to a hostile tone.

Considering the presence of derogatory terms, strong negative language, and a hostile tone, does the text exhibit characteristics of toxicity? Answer 'yes' or 'no'.
Based on the above reasoning, the text is toxic.

Therefore, the final answer is:
toxicity: []

"|"Okay, I can create a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying the given text as toxic or not.

<prompt>
First, carefully analyze the provided text. Consider the presence of insults, threats, hate speech, offensive language, and disrespectful or aggressive tone. Break down the text into smaller segments and evaluate each segment for potential toxicity. Identify the specific words, phrases, or sentences that contribute to a toxic sentiment. Determine the target of the toxicity – is it directed towards individuals, groups, or ideas? Evaluate the severity of the toxicity based on the intensity and impact of the offensive language. After a comprehensive analysis, determine whether the overall sentiment of the text is toxic. If the text contains elements of hate speech, personal attacks, or severe disrespect, classify it as toxic. If the text is primarily critical or negative but lacks overtly offensive language, it may not be classified as toxic. Finally, assign a binary classification: ""1"" if the text contains toxicity, and ""0"" if it does not.

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|"Here's an analysis of the provided text, broken down to assess its toxicity:

*   **""I call people like this CARPETBEGGARS.""** This uses a derogatory term (""CARPETBEGGARS"") to label a group of people, suggesting they are unwelcome and exploitative. This is an insult and contributes to a negative tone.

*   **""Zero respect for the state you move to.....thinking you can go to any state and just do what you want.""** This expresses a strong accusation of disrespect and entitlement. While not explicitly using slurs, it's critical and accusatory.

*   **""All of you.....check your intentions.""** This is a directive, implying the targeted group has malicious or questionable motives.

*   **""Legalizing cannabis for recreational purposes and your egos - has SCREWED medical patients.""** The word ""SCREWED"" is strong language, and the accusation links the actions of the targeted group to negative consequences for vulnerable individuals (medical patients).

*   **""Your agenda to regulate and tax a PLANT MEDICINE is seriously messed up being that you have systematically been dismantling the medical program with your legalization motives.""** ""Seriously messed up"" is an informal but strong expression of disapproval. This segment accuses the group of intentionally harming the medical program.

*   **""You have ZERO empathy for our state and the sick and suffering in it.""** This is a direct accusation of lacking empathy, which is a serious moral failing.

**Overall Assessment:**

The text employs derogatory labeling (""CARPETBEGGARS""), strong accusatory language, and accusations of malicious intent and lack of empathy. The tone is aggressive and disrespectful. While it doesn't contain explicit hate speech or direct threats, the intensity and accusatory nature of the language, combined with the derogatory label and accusations of harming vulnerable people, contribute to a toxic sentiment.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic language. We will use a step-by-step approach to identify potentially offensive or harmful content.

**Task:** Determine if the given text contains toxicity.

**Text:** 'I call people like this CARPETBEGGARS. Zero respect for the state you move to.....thinking you can go to any state and just do what you want. All of you.....check your intentions.

Your agenda to regulate and tax a PLANT MEDICINE is seriously messed up being that you have systematically been dismantling the medical program with your legalization motives. You have ZERO empathy for our state and the sick and suffering in it.'

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** Scan the text for insults, slurs, profanity, or other language intended to demean or harm. List any such terms.
2.  **Assess the target and intent:** Determine who the text is directed towards (e.g., a specific individual, a group, a general audience). Evaluate whether the language appears to be intended to attack, belittle, or incite hatred against this target.
3.  **Consider the context:** Take into account the overall tone and purpose of the text. Is it part of a heated debate? Is it a personal attack? Is the language used hyperbolic or satirical?
4.  **Determine the presence of toxicity:** Based on the previous steps, decide if the text contains language that is likely to be perceived as offensive, harmful, or malicious.
5.  **Assign the label:** If the text contains toxicity, assign the label '1'. If the text does not contain toxicity, assign the label '0'.

**Definitions:**

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, hurtful, or threatening. This includes insults, name-calling, hate speech, and personal attacks.')
*   ('Not Toxic', 'Language that is neutral, informative, or constructive. This may include strong opinions, but does not involve personal attacks or harmful statements.')

**Label Information:**

2.  **Target and Intent:** The text targets individuals who have moved to a new state and support the legalization of recreational cannabis. The intent is to express anger and resentment towards these individuals, accusing them of harming medical patients and lacking empathy.

3.  **Context:** The text appears to be part of a heated debate about cannabis legalization and its impact on medical users. The language is emotional and accusatory.

4.  **Presence of Toxicity:** The text uses insulting language (""CARPETBEGGARS""), makes sweeping generalizations (""All of you...check your intentions""), and accuses the targeted group of harmful actions and a lack of empathy. This language is likely to be perceived as offensive and harmful.

Your agenda to regulate and tax a PLANT MEDICINE is seriously messed up being that you have systematically been dismantling the medical program with your legalization motives. You have ZERO empathy for our state and the sick and suffering in it.'

First, identify any potentially offensive words or phrases. ""CARPETBEGGARS"" is a derogatory term. The phrases ""Zero respect,"" ""check your intentions"" (implying bad intentions), ""SCREWED medical patients,"" ""seriously messed up,"" and ""ZERO empathy"" all convey negative sentiment.

Second, consider the context in which these phrases are used. The author is clearly angry and accusing a group of people of harming medical patients. The use of ""CARPETBEGGARS"" is a direct insult, and the other phrases contribute to an overall tone of hostility and disrespect.

Third, evaluate the overall impact of the text. Does it promote hatred or discrimination? Does it attack individuals or groups? The text does attack a group of people moving to a state and accuse them of wrong doing, using insult and negative statements.

Based on this analysis, the text is considered toxic.

Therefore, the answer is:
toxicity: [ ]

```text
You are an expert in identifying toxic language. You will be provided with text excerpts and your task is to classify whether each excerpt contains toxic language or not. Toxicity includes hate speech, offensive language, personal attacks, and any content intended to demean or harm an individual or group.

The labels are defined as follows:
- 1: The text contains toxic language.
- 0: The text does not contain toxic language.

The language of the text is English.

Here are a few examples:

Text: ""This is a friendly greeting. Have a nice day!""
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You are a worthless piece of trash and should be ashamed of yourself.""
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""I disagree with your opinion, but I respect your right to have it.""

"||"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a Chain-of-Thought prompt that will guide a language model to classify a given text as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). The prompt should include explanations for the classification. The language of the text is English.

<prompt>
Let's think step by step. We are given a text and need to determine if it contains toxic content. Toxic content includes insults, threats, hate speech, and generally disrespectful or offensive language.

First, read the provided text carefully and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments.
Second, analyze the context of these potentially toxic elements. Determine if they are directed at an individual or group, and whether they are intended to harm, offend, or demean.
Third, consider the overall tone and intent of the text. Even if individual words are not inherently toxic, the cumulative effect might be toxic.
Finally, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). A text should be labeled as toxic (1) if it contains personal attacks, insults, obscene language, name-calling, hate speech, or any content that is intended to disparage or offend. Otherwise, it should be classified as non-toxic (0).

Here is the text:

Does this text contain toxicity?
toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|"Here's a breakdown of the text and the reasoning for classifying its toxicity:

1. **Potentially Toxic Elements:**
   - ""bullshit"": Profanity, generally considered offensive.
   - ""delusional stupid jerk"": Insulting language, personal attack.
   - ""full of crap"": Offensive, implies dishonesty and incompetence.

2. **Context Analysis:**
   - The phrases ""delusional stupid jerk"" and ""full of crap"" are directly targeted at ""the author,"" making it a personal attack.
   - ""bullshit,"" while not targeted at a specific individual, contributes to an overall negative and disrespectful tone.

3. **Overall Tone and Intent:**
   - The text expresses strong negativity and contempt towards the author.
   - The author of the text is intentionally trying to test the toxicity classifier by using strong insults.

4. **Classification:**
   - The text contains personal attacks, insults, and offensive language directed towards the author. Therefore, based on the instructions, it should be classified as toxic.

Final Answer: The text is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

*   **0:** Non-toxic or acceptable language.
*   **1:** Toxic or offensive language, including insults, threats, or strong profanity directed at an individual.

The final example is unrated, and I am unable to provide a judgement.
"|"Okay, I can create a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying text toxicity as either 1 (toxic) or 0 (not toxic), formatted as requested.

<prompt>
First, carefully read the following text and identify any potentially toxic elements within it. Consider elements like profanity, insults, threats, hate speech, or generally offensive language. Decompose the text into individual sentences or phrases and evaluate each one for its potential to be harmful or offensive. Then, assess the overall tone and intent of the text. Does the text aim to demean, insult, or threaten? Finally, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or not toxic (0). Toxic content includes but is not limited to hate speech, threats, insults, and profanity used in an offensive way.
Text: 'For the purposes of testing, here's my contribution:

lol wut wat a bunch of bullshit

the author is a delusional stupid jerk full of crap

(I just can't bring myself to use stronger profanity and personal attacks.)'

Now, think step by step.
The first sentence is introductory and doesn't express any toxicity. The second sentence includes the phrase ""bullshit"", that is offensive. The third sentence includes insults like ""delusional stupid jerk full of crap"" which are directly attacking the author. The parenthetical sentence acknowledges that the writer is holding back from using even more offensive language, reinforcing that there is a intention to be toxic. Based on the presence of offensive language and insults, the text should be considered toxic.

Therefore, the text is classified as toxic.
toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|"Okay, I understand the process. Here's the breakdown:

*   **Sentence 1:** 'For the purposes of testing, here's my contribution:' - **Not Toxic (0)** - Introductory, neutral.

*   **Sentence 2:** 'lol wut wat a bunch of bullshit' - **Toxic (1)** - Contains the term ""bullshit,"" which is considered profanity/offensive, although mild. The ""lol wut wat"" adds a mocking tone.

*   **Sentence 3:** 'the author is a delusional stupid jerk full of crap' - **Toxic (1)** - Contains multiple insults (""delusional,"" ""stupid,"" ""jerk,"" ""full of crap"") directly targeting the author. This is clearly offensive and intended to demean.

*   **Sentence 4:** '(I just can't bring myself to use stronger profanity and personal attacks.)' - **Toxic (1)** - While the sentence itself doesn't contain explicit profanity, it acknowledges the intent to use even *more* offensive language. This underscores the overall toxic intent of the contribution.

**Overall Tone and Intent:**

The overall tone is derisive, mocking, and insulting. The clear intent is to express negativity and contempt towards the author being discussed (even if hypothetical).

**Classification:**

Based on the presence of profanity, insults, and the expressed intent to use even stronger offensive language, the text is definitively **Toxic (1)**.

**Toxicity List:**

<prompt>
Let's analyze the provided text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach, considering different aspects of the text to arrive at a final classification.

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context: Toxicity includes language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. This encompasses hate speech, aggressive language, insults, and threats.

Now, let's consider these labels:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Presence of rude, disrespectful, or hateful language.')
*   ('Severity', 'Intensity or degree of toxicity expressed in the text.')

Here are the definitions of the label types:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Binary: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 otherwise.')
*   ('Language', 'Language of the text. In this case, English')

Now, let's break down the text:

Text: 'For the purposes of testing, here's my contribution:

lol wut wat a bunch of bullshit

the author is a delusional stupid jerk full of crap

(I just can't bring myself to use stronger profanity and personal attacks.)'

Step 1: Identify potentially toxic words or phrases. In this text, we find ""bullshit"", ""delusional"", ""stupid"", ""jerk"", and ""full of crap"".

Step 2: Assess the context of these phrases. The words are used to describe or insult someone, which indicates toxicity.

Step 3: Evaluate the overall tone of the text. The tone is negative and aggressive.

Step 4: Determine the presence of toxicity based on the previous steps. The text contains insults and disrespectful language.

Therefore, based on this analysis, does the text contain toxicity?

Answer with: toxicity: [] (1 if yes, 0 if no).

"|1.0|"Based on the provided examples and the label definition, the last text, ""For the purposes of testing, here's my contribution: ..."", should be classified as **toxic**.

*   **""Bullshit"":** While not the most offensive word, ""bullshit"" contributes to a negative and hostile tone.
*   **Context matters:** Although the author states they can't bring themselves to use stronger profanity, the intent is clearly to express negativity and contempt.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (either toxic or not toxic).

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic content in text. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine whether it contains toxic language. Toxicity includes profanity, insults, personal attacks, threats, and any language intended to offend, demean, or harm.

First, read the text carefully and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or statements. 
Second, consider the overall context and intent of the text. Is the language used in a joking manner, or is it genuinely meant to be harmful or offensive?
Third, based on your analysis, determine whether the text as a whole should be classified as toxic. If the text contains a significant amount of toxic language or expresses harmful sentiments, classify it as toxic. Otherwise, classify it as non-toxic.

The classification should be binary:
- 1: if the text is toxic.
- 0: if the text is not toxic.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a friendly message. Have a nice day!""
The text does not contain profanity, insults, or any harmful language. The context is positive and friendly. Therefore, the text is not toxic.

<\prompt>
"|"This is a good few-shot prompt. Here's a breakdown of why it's effective and some minor suggestions for potential improvements:

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear and Concise Instructions:** The introduction clearly defines the task and the coding (0 and 1 for toxic/non-toxic).
*   **Variety of Examples:** The examples cover a good range of sentiment and toxicity levels, including positive, neutral, and explicitly toxic statements. This helps the model understand the nuances of the task.
*   **Consistency of Format:** The `Text:` and `toxicity: [ ]` format is consistently used throughout, which is crucial for the model to understand the expected input and output.
*   **Realistic Examples:** The examples feel natural and representative of the type of text the model might encounter. The last example, while perhaps a little wordy, introduces a more nuanced case of potential toxicity.
*   **Demonstrates the Nuances of Toxicity:** The contrast between ""This is a great movie!"" and ""You are a complete idiot..."" helps the model learn to identify direct insults.

**Potential Improvements:**

*   **Specificity of Toxicity:** While the prompt uses the term ""toxic,"" it doesn't explicitly define what constitutes toxicity.  Consider adding a brief definition or broadening the examples. Toxicity can be subjective. Some might consider personal opinions or political statements as toxic even if they aren't directly insulting. Adding an example might help clarify the intended scope.  For example:

    *   `Text: ""I strongly disagree with their policies and think they are ruining the country.""`
    *   `toxicity: [0]` (Assuming disagreement is not inherently toxic for this task)

*   **Edge Cases/Subtleties:** Consider adding an example that represents a more subtle form of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior or indirect threats.  This can help the model handle more complex situations. For example:

    *   `Text: ""It's a shame you always seem to mess things up, but I'm sure you tried your best.""`
    *   `toxicity: [1]` (Depending on the intended definition of toxicity and whether passive aggression is considered toxic.)

*   **Length Considerations:** While the current length is fine, if you wanted to increase the prompt's effectiveness, you could add one or two more examples, further expanding the model's understanding of the nuances. However, balance this with the prompt's size limitations.

**Why it's likely to work well:**

The prompt provides a solid foundation for the model to learn the task. The combination of clear instructions, varied examples, and consistent formatting significantly increases the likelihood of a successful classification.  The empty `toxicity: []` encourages the model to fill in the missing classification, adhering to the specified format.

**How to use it (example):**

When you submit this prompt to a language model, you'd send the entire string (including the blank line) to the model. The model should then generate the classification within the brackets (e.g., `[0]` or `[1]`).

By implementing these suggestions (particularly adding an example that highlights subtle toxicity and perhaps clarifying the definition), you can further improve the prompt's effectiveness. Remember to evaluate the model's performance and adjust the prompt based on the results.
"|"Okay, I will generate a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying text as toxic or not, with the specified output format.

<prompt>
First, carefully read the following text:

""This is what a serious mental illness looks like, these paramilitaries/militias/”sovereign citizens”, a sociopathic paranoic delusional criminal hysteria, contagious to a degree, armed and very dangerous.""

Now, consider the following aspects to determine if the text contains toxicity:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive language:** Does the text use insults, slurs, or derogatory terms targeting specific groups or individuals?
2.  **Assess the presence of hate speech:** Does the text promote hatred, discrimination, or violence against any group based on their religion, ethnicity, origin, gender, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics?
3.  **Analyze the tone and intent:** Is the overall tone of the text aggressive, hostile, or intended to harm or offend? Is there an intention to demean, belittle, or dehumanize?
4.  **Consider the context:** Even if individual words seem harmless, does the surrounding context make them toxic?
5.  **Evaluate the impact:** Could the text potentially cause harm or distress to individuals or groups?

Based on your analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Answer with 1 if it does, and 0 if it doesn't.

Finally, output your answer in the following format: toxicity: []. Fill the brackets with your response.
<\prompt>
"|"Here's an analysis of the text and the determination of its toxicity:

*   **Offensive Language:** The text uses terms like ""sociopathic,"" ""paranoid,"" ""delusional,"" and ""criminal hysteria"" to describe a specific group. While these aren't slurs, they are pejorative and pathologize the individuals in question, which can be considered offensive.

*   **Hate Speech:** While the text doesn't target a protected characteristic like race or religion directly, it demonizes a group (paramilitaries/militias/""sovereign citizens"") and implicitly advocates for a negative view of them. The assertion that the group is ""contagious to a degree, armed and very dangerous"" arguably promotes fear and potentially violence against them.

*   **Tone and Intent:** The tone is aggressive and hostile. The intent seems to be to portray the targeted group as dangerous, mentally unstable, and a threat to society. The strong negative language and generalizations suggest a desire to demean and belittle this group.

*   **Context:** The context suggests a serious condemnation of the specified groups. The language used goes beyond simple disagreement and veers into potentially harmful rhetoric.

*   **Impact:** The text could cause distress to individuals who identify with or are associated with the groups mentioned. It could also contribute to the stigmatization and dehumanization of these groups, potentially inciting violence or discrimination against them.

Given the above analysis, the text contains toxicity.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will break down the text and identify any potentially harmful language.

**Text:** 'This is what a serious mental illness looks like, these paramilitaries/militias/”sovereign citizens”, a sociopathic paranoic delusional criminal hysteria, contagious to a degree, armed and very dangerous.'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context.

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened or unwelcome. This includes hate speech, aggressive insults, and threats.')
*   ('Not Toxic', 'Language that is neutral, polite, and does not contain any insults, threats, or offensive statements.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, examine the text and identify specific phrases or words that might indicate toxicity:

1.  The phrase ""serious mental illness looks like"" used to describe a group can be considered stigmatizing and potentially offensive.
2.  The terms ""sociopathic,"" ""paranoic,"" ""delusional,"" and ""criminal hysteria"" are highly negative and used to demean the group.
3.  The description ""contagious to a degree, armed and very dangerous"" implies a threat and contributes to a hostile tone.

Considering these elements, does the text contain toxic content based on our definition?

Let's think step by step. We are given a text and need to classify whether it contains toxicity or not. Toxicity refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened or attacked. The language of the text is English. First, carefully examine the text and identify any words, phrases, or statements that could be considered offensive, hateful, or discriminatory. Consider the target of the potentially toxic language. Who is the language directed towards? What is the intent of the speaker? Does the language promote violence, hatred, or discrimination? Does the language attack or demean an individual or group based on their gender, race, religion, or other protected characteristic? Based on your analysis, determine if the text is toxic. If the text contains toxic language, then the answer is 1. If the text does not contain toxic language, then the answer is 0.

**Analysis:**

*   **Offensive Language:** The text uses the word ""bitch,"" which is a derogatory and offensive term, particularly when directed at a woman.
*   **Target:** The language is directed towards a woman.
*   **Intent:** The intent is to demean and dismiss the woman's work (writing a book) based on her gender. It implies that women are inherently less capable or worthy of being read.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a binary classification: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.

Here's a breakdown to guide our thought process:

1.  **Identify potentially toxic elements:** Look for insults, threats, hate speech, or disrespectful language targeting individuals or groups.
2.  **Consider the context:** Evaluate the intent and overall tone of the text. Sarcasm or humor might mitigate seemingly toxic language, but explicit attacks should be flagged.
3.  **Apply the label definition:** Based on the identified elements and context, assign either 1 (toxic) or 0 (not toxic).

Here are the label definitions and other relevant information:

*   ('Toxicity', 'The text contains offensive language, insults, threats, or hate speech targeting individuals or groups.')
*   ('Not Toxicity', 'The text does not contain offensive language, insults, threats, or hate speech.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's apply this to the following text:

""This bitch is nuts. Who would read a book by a woman.""

First, let's identify potentially toxic element: the word ""bitch"" is a derogatory term. The second sentence can be interpreted as sexist.
Second, let's consider the context: The overall tone is disrespectful and dismissive towards women.
Third, apply the label definition: the text contain toxic element, so the label is toxicity

Therefore, based on our analysis, the text contains toxicity.

*   **0** indicates the text is **not toxic**.
*   **1** indicates the text is **toxic**.
*   **[]** indicates the text **should be toxic**.

Based on these examples, I can infer the following:

*   Positive and polite statements are considered non-toxic.
*   Direct insults, hateful language, and profanity are considered toxic.
*   Sexism should be considered toxic.

I am ready to use this knowledge to label new text examples. Just provide them.
"|"Okay, I will generate a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying text toxicity.

**Here's the breakdown:**

*   **Format of the text:** Simple sentences and phrases.
*   **Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the text contains toxic language, including hate speech, insults, threats, or offensive content.
*   **Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1). 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.
*   **Language of the text:** Primarily English.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the text to determine if it contains toxic content. Toxicity includes hate speech, insults, threats, or generally offensive language. We need to carefully evaluate the text and assign a binary label: 1 if it is toxic and 0 if it is not.

Here are a few examples:

*   Text: ""This is a wonderful day!""
    Reasoning: The text expresses a positive sentiment and does not contain any harmful or offensive language.
    toxicity: \[0]

*   Text: ""You are an idiot.""
    Reasoning: The text contains a direct insult and is therefore considered toxic.
    toxicity: \[1]

*   Text: ""I disagree with your opinion.""
    Reasoning: The text expresses disagreement, which is not inherently toxic.
    toxicity: \[0]

*   Text: ""I will destroy you.""
    Reasoning: The text contains a direct threat and is considered toxic.
    toxicity: \[1]

Now, consider the following text: 'This bitch is nuts. Who would read a book by a woman.'

First, identify any potentially offensive words or phrases. Does the text contain insults, hate speech, or threats? Evaluate the context in which these words/phrases are used. Based on your analysis, does the text qualify as toxic? Provide a toxicity label (1 for toxic, 0 for not toxic).

toxicity: \[ ]

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a step-by-step reasoning process to determine if the text contains toxic elements.

**Text:** 'So tired of all these Portlanders moving to California and ruining the culture. When will it stop?!?'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Includes hate speech, aggressive or bullying behavior, and personal attacks.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary (1 for toxic, 0 for not toxic)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, break down the text into smaller parts:

1.  **Identify potential targets:** Who is being targeted or discussed negatively in the text?
2.  **Analyze sentiment:** What is the overall feeling or emotion expressed in the text? Is it negative, angry, or hateful?
3.  **Look for specific toxic elements:** Does the text contain any insults, threats, stereotypes, or generalizations about a group of people? Does it promote hatred or violence?
4.  **Assess the impact:** Could the text be perceived as offensive, hurtful, or discriminatory by the targeted group or others?

Based on this analysis, does the text contain toxic elements? Explain your reasoning.

Finally, provide the toxicity classification in the following format:

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|1.0|"Okay, let's analyze the text: ""So tired of all these Portlanders moving to California and ruining the culture. When will it stop?!?""

**Step 1: Identify potential targets:**

The potential target is ""Portlanders"" - people from Portland. It's a geographical group. More specifically, it targets Portlanders *moving to California*.

**Step 2: Analyze sentiment:**

The overall sentiment is negative and expresses frustration. The phrases ""so tired of"" and ""ruining the culture"" indicate annoyance and disapproval. The question ""When will it stop?!"" further amplifies the negative feeling and suggests the speaker wants this perceived trend to end.

**Step 3: Look for specific toxic elements:**

The text contains a generalization about ""Portlanders"" and attributes a negative impact (""ruining the culture"") to their movement to California. While it doesn't contain overt insults, threats, or hate speech in the typical sense, it implies that Portlanders are unwelcome and damaging to California's culture. The phrase ""ruining the culture"" is potentially offensive because it ascribes negative consequences to an entire group of people based on their origin. The phrase could also be considered an example of ""othering,"" where a group is being designated as an unwanted outside influence.

**Step 4: Assess the impact:**

The text could be perceived as offensive and unwelcoming by Portlanders, especially those who have moved or are considering moving to California. It promotes a sense of division and resentment between people from different geographical locations. While it might not be as severe as explicit hate speech, it contributes to a negative stereotype and could contribute to a hostile environment for people from Portland in California. The broad assertion of ""ruining the culture"" is also subjective and difficult to prove, making it potentially misleading and inflammatory.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the definition of toxicity provided, this text contains toxic elements. It contains a negative generalization that could offend a specific geographical group. The text expresses negative sentiment toward this group and makes the claim of the Portlanders ""ruining the culture"" when moving to California.

    *   `1`: The text contains toxic content.
    *   `0`: The text does not contain toxic content.
*   **Definition of Toxicity:** Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or otherwise offensive language that could make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome.

**Format of the Text:** Simple sentences.

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the given task, following the requested format:

**Text Format:** Simple sentences, informal writing style.

**Label Explanation:** The label indicates the presence or absence of toxic content within the provided text. Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion.

**Label Type:** Binary classification (either present or absent).

**Language of the Text:** English.

<prompt>
Let's think step by step. We need to determine if the following text contains toxic content: 'So tired of all these Portlanders moving to California and ruining the culture.  When will it stop?!?'

First, consider the definition of toxicity: rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion.

Now, analyze the text. Does it contain any personal attacks or slurs? Does it express hatred towards a particular group? Does it use offensive language?

The text expresses frustration and blames a specific group ('Portlanders') for 'ruining the culture'. While it might not be overtly offensive, it implies a negative judgment and could be considered disrespectful and unwelcome towards people from Portland. The phrase ""ruining the culture"" is a value judgement that can be toxic.

Therefore, based on our analysis, the text contains toxicity.

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity can include hate speech, threats, insults, disrespectful language, or any statement that could be considered offensive or harmful.

Text: 'Enterprise licenses are available now, and we'll have tiered small business plans available very soon! We will also have a free, public version out later this year.'

First, consider whether the text contains any explicit or implicit insults.
Second, evaluate if the text promotes violence, hatred, or discrimination against any individual or group.
Third, check if the text uses offensive language or targets any person or group with malicious intent.

Based on the analysis above, does the text contain toxicity? Answer 1 if it does, and 0 if it does not.

The text is in English.

Therefore, the final answer is: toxicity: []

Now, let's break down the process of determining if the text contains toxicity. Consider the following aspects:

1.  **Identify potential indicators of toxicity:** Look for profanity, insults, threats, hate speech, discriminatory language, or any language intended to demean, harass, or offend.
2.  **Assess the context:** Even if some words or phrases *could* be considered toxic in some situations, determine if that is the intent in the given context. Is the language being used to attack someone, or is it being used in a harmless way?
3.  **Make a final determination:** Based on the presence (or absence) of toxic indicators and the overall context, classify the text. If the text contains any of the indicators and is used in a harmful way, categorize it as toxic. If not, categorize it as non-toxic.

**Definitions:**
*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Contains any of the following: threats, insults, identity hate, obscenity, or severe profanity. Also, any of the previous points directed to a group of people, or inciteful phrases.')
*   ('Non-Toxicity', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and does not contain any elements of hate speech, threats, insults, obscenity, or profanity.')

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Initial Assessment:** Read the text and get a general impression. Does it feel like it contains toxic elements?
2.  **Identify Potential Issues:** Are there any words or phrases that could be considered rude, disrespectful, or offensive?
3.  **Check for Hate Speech:** Does the text target any individual or group based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.?
4.  **Examine Tone:** Is the overall tone of the text positive, negative, or neutral? Is there any aggression or hostility?
5.  **Consider Context:** Could the text be interpreted as toxic depending on the context in which it's used?
6.  **Synthesize and Classify:** Based on the above steps, decide whether the text is toxic or non-toxic.

"|0.0|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying text as toxic or non-toxic, with specific formatting instructions for the answer.

Here's the breakdown for the prompt:

*   **Explanation of Label:** The label 'toxicity' refers to the presence of rude, disrespectful, or offensive language within the text. It encompasses personal attacks, insults, threats, and any content intended to demean or harm an individual or group.
*   **Language of the Text:** The language of the text is English.

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier specializing in identifying toxic content. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine whether it contains toxic elements. Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or offensive language, including personal attacks, insults, threats, or any content intended to demean or harm an individual or group.

First, carefully read the text and identify any instances of potentially toxic language. Consider the context in which the words are used and whether the intent is to be harmful or offensive.

Second, provide a brief explanation of your reasoning. Detail the specific words, phrases, or sentences that contribute to the toxicity, if present. Explain why you believe the identified elements constitute toxic language based on the definition provided.

Third, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic or non-toxic. If you identify even a single instance of toxic language, classify the entire text as toxic.

Finally, answer with the label ""toxicity: []"", placing either '1' if the text contains toxicity or '0' if the text does not contain toxicity within the square brackets.

"|"The text expresses frustration and disagreement with a journalist's portrayal of the author and their friends. While the author uses sarcasm (""That's some real class A journalism""), and accuses the journalist of ""trashing"" them, the language does not rise to the level of personal attacks, insults, threats, or intent to demean or harm. The criticism is directed at the journalist's actions and the content of the article, rather than the journalist as a person. The term ""antagonizing"" suggests the author feels provoked, but it's not inherently toxic.

"|"toxicity: [0]
"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying text toxicity as 1 (toxic) or 0 (not toxic), with the specified output format:

<prompt>
First, analyze the given text to identify any potentially toxic elements. Consider if the text contains hate speech, offensive language, insults, threats, or targets individuals or groups in a harmful or discriminatory manner. Look for words or phrases that promote violence, incite hatred, or demean others based on their identity or characteristics. Also, analyze the overall sentiment and tone of the text. Does it express anger, hostility, or negativity that could be considered harmful or offensive?

Now, based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity. If the text contains any of the elements mentioned above, classify it as toxic (1). If the text is generally neutral, positive, or only expresses opinions without being offensive or harmful, classify it as not toxic (0).

Text: 'To anyone reading this article. That's me and my friends in this picture. I would like to point out this ""journalist"" asked us zero questions. She just snapped our picture and left. And then writes an article trashing us, with no background? That's some real class A journalism. Kigurmi run by Sazac is a European company.

And if that wasn't bad enough the whole second half is trashing furries? Maybe next time you should think before writing an article antagonizing teenagers trying to do their Christmas tradition of getting pictures with Santa...'

Therefore, the classification is:
toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|"Let's analyze the text for potential toxicity.

The text expresses frustration and anger towards a journalist. The author feels misrepresented and unfairly criticized in an article. They use sarcasm (""real class A journalism"") and accuse the journalist of ""trashing"" them and their friends. They also question the logic of the journalist's argument regarding cultural appropriation and the criticism of furries.

While the author is clearly upset and uses strong language, the text doesn't contain hate speech, direct insults targeting specific individuals with derogatory terms, threats, or promotion of violence. The criticism is directed at the journalist's actions and the content of the article, rather than attacking the journalist's personal characteristics. The tone is negative and accusatory, but it doesn't cross the line into outright toxicity.

Therefore, the classification is:

toxicity: [0]

To classify whether the given text contains toxicity or not, follow this chain of thought:

1. Read the text carefully to understand its content and tone.
2. Identify any words, phrases, or sentiments that could be considered toxic, such as insults, sarcasm, or aggressive language.
3. Determine if the overall tone of the text is negative or hostile, even if no explicit toxic words are used.
4. Consider the context of the text—does it attack or demean individuals or groups, or does it express frustration in a non-toxic way?
5. Based on the above analysis, decide if the text meets the criteria for toxicity (1) or not (0).
6. Output the result in the format: 'toxicity: []', where the square brackets contain either 1 or 0.

1. **Tone and Intent**: The text expresses frustration and criticism toward a journalist and the article written about the author and their friends. The language is sarcastic (""That's some real class A journalism"") and defensive, but it does not include direct insults, hate speech, or demeaning remarks targeting individuals or groups in a harmful way.

2. **Content**: The author challenges the journalist's actions (e.g., not asking questions, trashing them without background) and disputes claims about cultural appropriation and criticism of furries. While the tone is confrontational, the arguments are focused on the perceived unfairness of the article rather than personal attacks or offensive language.

3. **Potential Toxicity Indicators**:  
   - Sarcasm (""real class A journalism"") could be seen as mildly aggressive but is not overtly toxic.  
   - The criticism is directed at the journalist's work, not their personal attributes (e.g., no name-calling or slurs).  
   - No hate speech, threats, or explicit offensive terms are used.  

4. **Conclusion**: The text is critical and sarcastic but does not cross into toxicity as defined (harmful, offensive, or aggressive language). It falls under a defensive rebuttal rather than a toxic attack.

**Answer**:  
toxicity: [0]"|"Okay, I will create a chain-of-thought prompt for classifying text toxicity.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to determine if the text contains toxic elements.

**Text:** 'To anyone reading this article. That's me and my friends in this picture. I would like to point out this ""journalist"" asked us zero questions. She just snapped our picture and left. And then writes an article trashing us, with no background? That's some real class A journalism. Kigurmi run by Sazac is a European company.

And if that wasn't bad enough the whole second half is trashing furries? Maybe next time you should think before writing an article antagonizing teenagers trying to do their Christmas tradition of getting pictures with Santa...'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel upset or threatened. It can include insults, name-calling, and offensive generalizations.')
*   ('Severity', 'The degree to which the toxicity is present in the text. High severity implies direct attacks or severe offense, while low severity suggests mild insults or negativity.')

Now, break down the text and identify potentially toxic elements:

1.  **Identify potential insults or disrespectful language:** Does the text contain any direct insults or name-calling? Does it demean or belittle any individual or group?
2.  **Assess the tone and sentiment:** Is the overall tone of the text negative or aggressive? Does the author express anger or frustration in a way that could be considered toxic?
3.  **Look for offensive generalizations or stereotypes:** Does the text make generalizations about any group of people that could be considered offensive or discriminatory?
4.  **Determine the target of the toxicity:** Is the toxicity directed at a specific individual, a group, or a concept?

Based on this analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity and classify it accordingly:

*   ('Label definition', 'A binary label indicating the presence or absence of toxicity in the text.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification (0 or 1)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Finally, provide your answer in the following format:

toxicity: []
(Replace the square brackets with 1 if toxic and 0 if not toxic)
<\prompt>
"|1.0|"Here's an analysis of the provided text, broken down according to the prompt's instructions:

1. **Identify potential insults or disrespectful language:**

*   ""That's some real class A journalism"" - This is sarcastic and implies the journalist's work is actually very bad, potentially disrespectful.
*   ""Trashing us"" and ""trashing furries"" - These phrases, while not direct insults, suggest a negative and unfair portrayal.
*   ""Antagonizing teenagers"" - Accuses the journalist of intentionally upsetting the teenagers.

2. **Assess the tone and sentiment:**

*   The overall tone is defensive, frustrated, and accusatory. The author is clearly upset by the article. The use of phrases like ""that wasn't bad enough"" shows a high degree of negative emotion.

3. **Look for offensive generalizations or stereotypes:**

*   While the author argues *against* what they perceive as an unfair generalization, there is no creation of new stereotypes in the text.

4. **Determine the target of the toxicity:**

*   The primary target is the ""journalist"" who wrote the article. Secondary is the article itself and implicitly those who hold similar views.

Based on this analysis, the text *does* contain toxic elements. While it doesn't contain explicit slurs or hateful language, the accusatory tone, sarcastic insult (""class A journalism""), and claims of unfair portrayal contribute to a negative and potentially upsetting message for the journalist involved.

Therefore, the answer is:

toxicity: [1]
"|"Okay, I will create a few-shot prompt for classifying text toxicity, following the specified format.

toxicity: [0]

**Reasoning:**

While the text expresses anger and frustration, it doesn't contain explicit hate speech, personal attacks, or toxic language directed at individuals.  It criticizes a journalist's actions and article, but the criticism doesn't cross the line into being toxic based on the given label definition.  The language used (""trashing,"" ""antagonizing"") is critical but not inherently hateful or abusive. Therefore, it is best characterized as non-toxic within the scope of this classification task.
"|"Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a few-shot prompt that instructs a language model to classify text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). The model should output its classification in the format ""toxicity: []"".

"|"Okay, I understand the task. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed for classifying text toxicity.

**Text Format:** Simple sentences, part of a online conversation.

**Label Explanation:** The label indicates whether the text contains toxic content or not. Toxicity can include hate speech, offensive language, threats, insults, or any language intended to demean, marginalize, or cause harm to an individual or group.

**Label Type:** Binary classification (0 or 1).

**Language of Text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic content in text. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine whether it contains toxic language. Consider elements such as insults, threats, hate speech, offensive terms, and any language that could be harmful or disrespectful to individuals or groups.

First, carefully read and understand the provided text.
Second, break down the text into smaller parts and analyze each part for toxic content.
Third, based on your analysis, make a judgment whether the text contains toxicity.
Finally, provide a single numerical label: 1 if the text contains toxicity, and 0 if it does not.
Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a friendly message.""
The text doesn't contain insults, threats, or offensive language.
Therefore, the text is not toxic.
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You are a stupid idiot!""
The text contains insults and offensive language.
Therefore, the text is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

The prompt should guide the model to first analyze the text for potentially toxic elements (like insults, disparaging remarks, stereotypes, etc.) and then, based on that analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). The final answer must be in the format ""toxicity: []"".

Here's the prompt:

\<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity can include insults, threats, hate speech, disrespectful language, or any content intended to demean or harm an individual or group.

Text: 'Well, they (Republicans) say progressives are wimps.  Looks like they may be right, or maybe with guy really isn't a Progressive.'

First, identify any potentially toxic elements in the text. Does the text contain any insults or derogatory terms? Does it target any individual or group based on their political affiliation or other characteristics? Is the language used disrespectful or demeaning?

In this case, the text contains the statement ""progressives are wimps"". While ""wimps"" is not overtly hateful, it can be considered a derogatory term, depending on the context, used to belittle a group (progressives).  The text also expresses a potentially dismissive tone regarding someone's identity as a 'Progressive'.

Based on this analysis, determine if the text should be classified as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). Consider the severity and intent of the potentially toxic elements identified.

Now, provide the final answer in the format: toxicity: [].

</prompt>"|1.0|toxicity: [1]|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, formatted as requested:

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will break down the process step-by-step to ensure accuracy.

**Text:** 'Well, they (Republicans) say progressives are wimps. Looks like they may be right, or maybe with guy really isn't a Progressive.'

First, consider the definitions:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Text that contains rude, disrespectful, or otherwise offensive language or targets an individual or group with malicious intent. This includes insults, threats, hate speech, and profanity.')
*   ('Not Toxic', 'Text that does not contain offensive language, personal attacks, or malicious intent. It may express disagreement or criticism without being abusive.')

Now, let's analyze the given text:

1.  **Identify potential offensive words or phrases:** Does the text contain insults, slurs, profanity, or any derogatory language directed at individuals or groups?
2.  **Assess the intent:** Is the primary goal of the text to attack, demean, or threaten someone?
3.  **Consider the context:** Does the surrounding conversation or situation provide additional information that clarifies the meaning or intent of the text?

Based on your analysis, determine if the text is toxic or not. If the text contains toxic elements as defined above, assign a value of 1. If the text does not contain toxic elements, assign a value of 0.

Here are the label definitions and types for your consideration:

*   ('Label definition', '1: The text contains toxic elements. 0: The text does not contain toxic elements.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Finally, provide your answer in the following format:

toxicity: []
<\prompt>
"|0.0|"Here's an analysis of the provided text:

1. **Identify potential offensive words or phrases:** The word ""wimps"" could be considered offensive depending on the context and how it's interpreted. It's a derogatory term used to imply weakness or lack of courage.

2. **Assess the intent:** The intent seems to be critical and argumentative. The statement suggests a perceived weakness in progressives, potentially based on actions or lack thereof. While the word ""wimps"" is used, the overall intent is more argumentative than malicious. It's a generalization about a political group rather than a direct personal attack.

3. **Consider the context:** Without further context, it's difficult to definitively say whether this is toxic. The statement is critical of a political group, but it doesn't contain hate speech, threats, or direct personal insults. The lack of specifics and direct targeting makes it less overtly toxic.

Based on this analysis, the text is borderline. While ""wimps"" is a negative term, the overall statement aims at political criticism rather than direct abuse or malice. Given the definition of toxicity as including language targeting a group *with malicious intent*, the intent here seems more argumentative than malicious.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach.

First, let's define what we mean by ""toxicity"" in this context.
('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to rude, disrespectful, or otherwise negative language that could cause emotional harm or offense. This includes insults, threats, hate speech, and disparaging remarks.')
('Label type', 'Binary: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 if it does not.')
('Language', 'English')

Now, consider the text: 'Voodoo Doughnut lines are still crazy, see the whole story at http://www.theportlanddream.com'.

Step 1: Identify any potentially offensive words or phrases. Does the text use any insults, slurs, or pejoratives?
Step 2: Does the text express hatred or contempt towards any individual or group?
Step 3: Does the text make any threats or promote violence?
Step 4: Does the text contain any profanity or obscenity used in a harmful way?
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, does the text exhibit any characteristics of toxicity as defined earlier?

Final Answer: toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Okay, let's analyze the text ""Voodoo Doughnut lines are still crazy, see the whole story at http://www.theportlanddream.com"" using the defined steps.

*   **Step 1: Identify any potentially offensive words or phrases.** The words ""Voodoo,"" ""Doughnut,"" ""lines,"" ""still,"" ""crazy,"" ""see,"" ""whole,"" ""story,"" ""at,"" ""http,"" ""www,"" ""theportlanddream,"" and ""com"" are all neutral in this context. The word ""crazy"" *could* be considered mildly offensive in some contexts, particularly when referring to mental health. However, in this context, it is likely used colloquially to mean ""very busy"" or ""wildly popular,"" which isn't toxic.

*   **Step 2: Does the text express hatred or contempt towards any individual or group?** No, the text does not express hatred or contempt towards any individual or group.

*   **Step 3: Does the text make any threats or promote violence?** No, the text does not make any threats or promote violence.

*   **Step 4: Does the text contain any profanity or obscenity used in a harmful way?** No, the text contains no profanity or obscenity.

*   **Step 5: Based on the above analysis, does the text exhibit any characteristics of toxicity as defined earlier?** Based on the analysis, the text does not exhibit any characteristics of toxicity as defined. While the word ""crazy"" *could* be considered in some contexts as insensitive, in this context it is not causing emotional harm or offense.

"|1.0|"Okay, I understand. Based on the provided examples and the label definition, here's the pattern I've identified:

*   **Toxicity Label [1]:** Indicates the text contains toxic content, such as hate speech, insults, or threats.
*   **Toxicity Label [0]:** Indicates the text is not considered toxic and is generally positive, neutral, or polite.

"|0.0|"Okay, I've reviewed the provided examples and understand the task.  The goal is to categorize text based on whether it expresses toxicity or not. Here's a breakdown of how I'm interpreting ""toxicity"" in this context and some observations about the last example:

*   **Toxicity (1):** Includes hate speech, insults, personal attacks, and generalizations that promote prejudice or discrimination.
*   **Non-Toxicity (0):**  Generally positive or neutral statements, observations, or opinions that do not attack or demean individuals or groups.

**Regarding the last example:**

The provided categorization has `toxicity: []` for the text: `""Voodoo Doughnut lines are still crazy, see the whole story at http://www.theportlanddream.com""`

This is interesting. My assessment depends on the purpose. Here's a more nuanced view:

*   **Without further context, it's likely NOT toxic (0):** On the surface, the sentence is a neutral observation about a popular business and includes a link.  It does not contain insults, hate speech, or personal attacks.
*   **Potentially toxic (1) if the linked website contains toxic content:** If the website itself promotes hate speech or misinformation, then posting a link to it could be considered a form of spreading toxicity.

**Conclusion**

Given that I have to decide solely on the basis of the presented text, and without visiting the link, I would classify it as **toxicity: [0]**.
"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed for toxicity classification, adhering to your specified requirements.

**Text Format:** Simple sentences (likely from social media, comments, or similar sources).

**Label Explanation:** The label indicates the presence or absence of toxic content within the given text. Toxicity can include hate speech, insults, threats, or any language intended to offend, demean, or harm.

**Label Definition:** Binary classification (two classes):
*   0: The text does not contain toxic content.
*   1: The text contains toxic content.

**Language of Text:** English

<prompt>
I need you to classify if a given piece of text contains toxicity or not. Consider that toxicity includes hate speech, insults, threats, or any language intended to offend, demean, or harm. You must output a binary classification: 1 if the text contains toxicity, and 0 if it does not. You must reason step by step and at the end output the answer following the requested format.

Here are some examples:

Text: ""I love you""
First, analyze the text for any hateful, offensive, or demeaning language. The text expresses affection and contains no toxicity. Therefore, the text is not toxic.
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You are so stupid, I hate you""
First, analyze the text for any hateful, offensive, or demeaning language. The text contains insults (""stupid"") and expresses hatred, which qualifies as toxic. Therefore, the text is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Text: ""This is a good song""
First, analyze the text for any hateful, offensive, or demeaning language. The text expresses a positive opinion about a song and contains no toxicity. Therefore, the text is not toxic.
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""I'm gonna kill you!""
First, analyze the text for any hateful, offensive, or demeaning language. The text contains a direct threat of violence, which qualifies as toxic. Therefore, the text is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Text: 'Voodoo Doughnut lines are still crazy, see the whole story at http://www.theportlanddream.com'
First, analyze the text for any hateful, offensive, or demeaning language. The text describes a doughnut shop and its popularity, without containing any toxicity. Therefore, the text is not toxic.

"|"This is a well-designed few-shot prompt! It is clear, concise, and provides good examples to guide the model. Here are some of its strengths:

*   **Clear Task Definition:** The initial sentence directly states the classification task and the desired output.
*   **Concise Output Format:** Enforcing a specific format ( `toxicity: []`) simplifies post-processing and evaluation.
*   **Balanced Examples:** The inclusion of both positive (non-toxic) and negative (toxic) examples is crucial for effective learning.
*   **Variety in Toxicity:** The toxic examples demonstrate different levels and styles of toxicity (direct insults, condescending remarks). This helps the model generalize beyond simple keyword matching.
*   **Real-World Examples:** The examples feel realistic and representative of the type of text found in online comments and discussions.
*   **Inclusion of Neutral Example:** The final example you provide is neutral in tone and context. It is crucial to include more of these as you create a comprehensive few shot dataset.

**Possible Enhancements (for even better performance):**

*   **More Examples:** Increasing the number of examples in the few-shot prompt can further improve accuracy, especially for nuanced cases.
*   **Edge Cases:** Include examples that are borderline toxic or may be misclassified due to sarcasm, irony, or regional slang. For instance, ""Okay, boomer"" can be seen as toxic depending on the context.
*   **Explain ""Toxicity"" Criteria (Optional):**  You could briefly mention what defines toxicity in this context (e.g., ""Toxicity includes insults, threats, hate speech, and any language that intends to harm or degrade others.""). While the examples are helpful, a written definition can provide additional clarity.  However, providing a written definition also adds the risk of the model relying more on the definition than the examples, which might be suboptimal.
*   **Specificity to a Domain:** Is the model meant to classify toxicity in tweets or comment sections? The specific context might have slightly different thresholds for classifying toxicity. If you know the general context, provide relevant examples.
*   **Consider Demographic Factors:** While being very careful not to inadvertently reinforce biases, consider that toxicity is experienced differently by different demographic groups (race, gender, etc.) and adapt your examples accordingly.

**Final Thoughts:**

This is an excellent starting point. By refining the examples and potentially adding a brief definition of toxicity, you can create an even more effective few-shot prompt for classifying text toxicity. The clear output format and the balanced examples are particularly well-executed.

<prompt>
Let's think step by step. We need to determine if the given text contains any toxic content. Toxic content can include hate speech, threats, insults, or any language that is offensive, disrespectful, or intended to harm or demean.

First, read the text carefully and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments. Consider the context in which these words or phrases are used.

Second, evaluate the severity and intent of the potentially toxic content. Is it genuinely harmful, or is it merely expressing a strong opinion? Does the language target any individual or group in a negative way?

Third, based on your evaluation, decide whether the text as a whole should be classified as toxic. If the text contains even a small amount of toxic content that is likely to be harmful or offensive, it should be classified as toxic.

Here are the label definitions:

- ('Toxicity', 'Whether the text contains toxic content such as hate speech, threats, insults, or disrespectful language.')
- ('Non-toxic', 'The text does not contain toxic content')

Here are the label types:

- ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 if toxic, 0 if not toxic')

Here is the language:

- ('Language', 'English')

Now, classify the following text as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0):

"|"Okay, I will generate a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying the toxicity of a given text.

**Format of the text:** Simple sentences, like a comment on an article.

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the text contains toxic content or not. Toxicity can include hate speech, insults, threats, or any language that is offensive, disrespectful, or intended to harm.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1).

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in online texts. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine if it contains any form of toxicity, including hate speech, insults, threats, or offensive language. You must provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, step by step, before stating your final classification. The final classification should be presented in the format: 'toxicity: [classification]', where classification is either 0 (not toxic) or 1 (toxic).

Here's how you should approach the task:

1.  **Carefully read the text** and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or statements.
2.  **Analyze the context** of the text to determine if the potentially toxic elements are genuinely harmful or if they are used in a non-toxic way (e.g., sarcasm, humor).
3.  **Consider the intent** of the author, if discernible. Was the author trying to attack, demean, or threaten someone?
4.  **Evaluate the potential impact** of the text on the reader. Could it cause offense, distress, or harm?
5.  **Provide a clear and concise explanation** of your reasoning, outlining the factors that led you to your final classification.
6.  **State your final classification** in the required format: 'toxicity: [0 or 1]'

Now, analyze the following example and provide your classification:

Text: 'Congratulations to Civil Comments (whose founder/architect Aja is a model of both civility and intellectual engagement) and to Willamette Week for being a trendsetter again in community journalism.'

Let's think step by step.
The text expresses congratulations and positive sentiments. There are no words or phrases that indicate hate speech, insults, threats, or offensive language. The context is celebratory and complimentary. The intent of the author appears to be to praise and acknowledge the achievements of the mentioned individuals and organizations. The text is unlikely to cause offense, distress, or harm to the reader.

Therefore, the classification is:

Step 1: Examine the text for any explicit or implicit offensive language, insults, or threats. Does the text directly attack or demean any individual or group?

Step 2: Evaluate the tone of the text. Is it respectful and constructive, or is it aggressive and inflammatory?

Step 3: Consider the context of the text. Could the text be interpreted as promoting hate speech or violence?

Step 4: Based on your analysis of the text's language, tone, and context, determine whether it meets the definition of toxicity.

"|0.0|"Okay, I understand. You've provided examples of text snippets and their corresponding toxicity classifications.  A classification of `[0]` indicates the text is non-toxic, `[1]` indicates it is toxic, and `[]` means it is unclear based on the text alone. This will help me understand what to look for when classifying new text.
"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task described.

**Format of the text:** Simple sentence containing an URL

**Explanation of the label:** The label indicates whether the provided text contains toxic content.

**Definition of the type of the label:** Binary classification (0 or 1).

**Language of the text:** English.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine whether it contains toxic content (e.g., hate speech, insults, threats). You will provide a step-by-step reasoning to justify your classification, and then output the final answer in the specified format.

First, carefully read the text.
Second, consider the different types of toxicity, like insults, threats, hate speech, and obscenity.
Third, analyze if the text contains any of these types of toxicity, focusing on the URL content.
Finally, based on your analysis, provide the classification in the required format: ""toxicity: [0 or 1]"".

Here is an example of how you should think:

Text: ""This is a wonderful day!""
The text does not contain any insults, threats, or hate speech. Therefore, it is not toxic.
toxicity: [0]

Text: ""You are a stupid idiot!""
The text contains insults directed at a person. Therefore, it is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: '[Here's a relevant quote.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nxulBvR_C10/TyUCme22ieI/AAAAAAAAO5Y/Ly6lN61B_as/w506-h285/dumbledore_quote_w1.jpeg)'

"|0.0|"The text consists of a Markdown link. The visible text ""Here's a relevant quote."" does not contain any toxic content. The link itself points to an image hosted on googleusercontent.com. Without accessing and analyzing the image content, it is impossible to determine if the image contains toxic content such as hate speech, insults, or threats. However, assuming the image is a harmless quote as suggested by the link's text, there is no indication of toxicity. Therefore, based solely on the information provided in the given text, it is unlikely to be toxic.

Second, let's consider the statement ""V1AGR4 F0R CHEEEEEP. Save Money at http://fakelink.to/Aeff2#"". The language used is clearly an attempt to advertise something by bypassing spam filters and the URL looks suspicious.

Based on the presence of spam and a potentially malicious link, the text is toxic.

**Text:** 'I want to see what happens to spammy comments so please flag this one appropriately. 

V1AGR4 F0R CHEEEEEP. Save Money at http://fakelink.to/Aeff2#'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context.
('Label definition', 'Toxicity refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone want to leave a discussion. It can include hate speech, threats, insults, and offensive language.')
('Label type', 'Binary: The text is either toxic or not toxic.')
('Language', 'English')

Now, break down the text into smaller parts and identify potential indicators of toxicity.
1.  The phrase ""I want to see what happens to spammy comments so please flag this one appropriately."" appears to be a request to test the system, and on its own is not toxic
2.  The phrase ""V1AGR4 F0R CHEEEEEP"" contains a misspelling of the drug Viagra which is used to treat erectile disfunction, this is most likely a spam message.
3.  The phrase ""Save Money at http://fakelink.to/Aeff2#"" contains a link which is most likely a spam link.

Considering these observations, does the text contain any elements of hate speech, threats, insults, or offensive language directly targeted at individuals or groups? Is the text intended to be rude, disrespectful, or make someone want to leave a discussion? Considering that the text is promoting something illegal, we can say that it contains toxicity.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, classify the text as either toxic (1) or not toxic (0).

*   **Insults and name-calling:** Words like ""stupid,"" ""idiot,"" ""worthless,"" ""trash,"" etc.
*   **Hate speech:** Language targeting individuals or groups based on protected characteristics.
*   **Threats:** Statements indicating an intent to cause harm.

In the case of the last example, the text contains spam and a disguised link. While it doesn't contain explicitly toxic language like insults or threats, spam and malicious links are undesirable and violate community guidelines.

You are an expert text classifier specializing in identifying toxic content. You will be provided with a text sample, and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic elements. Toxicity is defined as language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Explicit threats, insults, hate speech, and aggressive language are all considered toxic. Subtle negativity and disrespectful comments can also be toxic.

The text is in English and consists of simple sentences and phrases.

The label is binary:
*   **1:** The text contains toxicity.
*   **0:** The text does not contain toxicity.

Here's how to approach the task using chain-of-thought reasoning:

1.  **Carefully read the entire text sample.** Pay close attention to the specific words and phrases used.
2.  **Identify any potentially offensive words, insults, or threats.** Consider the context in which these words are used.
3.  **Assess the overall tone of the text.** Is it respectful and polite, or is it rude and aggressive?
4.  **Determine if the text promotes hate speech or targets specific individuals or groups.**
5.  **Based on your analysis, decide whether the text meets the definition of toxicity.**
6.  **Output your classification in the following format: toxicity: [classification]**, where `classification` is either 1 or 0.

For example, consider this text: ""This is a friendly message."" The reasoning would be: ""The text does not contain any offensive language, insults, or threats. The tone is respectful and polite. Therefore, the text is not toxic."" The output would be: toxicity: [0]

**Reasoning:** The text contains a direct insult (""idiot""). The phrase ""useless idiot"" is likely to offend and upset the recipient. This falls under the category of toxic language.

**Output:** `toxicity: [1]`

Now, apply this reasoning to the following text:

**Text:** 'I advise the Feds to follow the money that is given to these anti American religious sovereign terrorists.'

**Output:**
</prompt>
"|"1.  **Carefully read the provided text:** The text accuses a group of being ""anti American religious sovereign terrorists.""
2.  **Consider the intent and potential impact of the language:** This language is likely to incite hatred and fear towards the group being described. Labeling them as ""terrorists"" is a serious accusation with potentially harmful consequences.
3.  **Assess whether the language falls under any of the categories of toxic language:** The text uses inflammatory language that can be considered hate speech, as it targets a group based on their perceived religious and political beliefs and accuses them of terrorism.
4.  **Make a final decision:** The text contains toxic language.

**Output:** `toxicity: [1]`

"|"Okay, I will create a Chain-of-Thought prompt for classifying text toxicity.

<prompt>
First, read the following text carefully. Then, break down the text into smaller parts and analyze each part for potentially toxic elements such as insults, threats, hate speech, or disparaging remarks. Consider the overall context and intention of the text. Finally, based on your analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity. If the text contains any toxic elements, classify it as '1'. Otherwise, classify it as '0'.

Text: 'I advise the Feds to follow the money that is given to these anti American religious sovereign terrorists.'

Let's think step by step.
The text refers to 'anti American religious sovereign terrorists'. This phrase could be considered a disparaging label targeting a specific group. The phrase also carries a strong negative connotation.
Therefore, the text contains toxicity.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the given text for toxicity. Follow these steps to determine the presence of toxicity:

1.  **Understand the Definition of Toxicity:** Consider toxicity as any language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone want to leave a discussion. This includes threats, insults, identity-based attacks, profanity, and sexually explicit language. Consider also any language that promotes violence or discrimination.

2.  **Examine the Text:** Carefully read the text provided. Identify any words, phrases, or sentiments that align with the definition of toxicity.

3.  **Assess the Severity:** Determine the overall severity of the toxicity. Even subtle forms of disrespect or negativity should be considered.

4.  **Provide Classification:** Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic or non-toxic.

Here are the definitions for the labels we'll be using:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone want to leave a discussion. This includes threats, insults, identity-based attacks, profanity, and sexually explicit language. Consider also any language that promotes violence or discrimination.')
*   ('Non-Toxicity', 'Language that is respectful, polite, and does not contain any elements of rudeness, threats, insults, or offensive content.')

Here is the type of label we'll be using:

*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates the absence of toxicity.')

Here is the language of the text:

*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's apply this to the following text:

Text: 'I advise the Feds to follow the money that is given to these anti American religious sovereign terrorists.'

Reasoning: The text contains language that could be interpreted as hateful and discriminatory towards specific religious groups. Labeling them as ""anti American religious sovereign terrorists"" implies a negative generalization and could be seen as an attack on their identity and beliefs. This can be considered as a form of toxicity.

"|1.0|"Okay, I understand. Based on the provided examples, I can create a simple classification model.  Here's my understanding of the task and how I'll approach it:

**Understanding:**

*   **Goal:** Classify text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).
*   **Input:** English text.
*   **Output:** Binary label (0 or 1).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Toxic Words/Phrases:** Words like ""hate,"" ""stupid,"" phrases like ""unacceptable behavior,"" ""should be ashamed of yourself"" are indicative of toxicity.
    *   **Positive/Neutral Sentiment:** Phrases like ""Have a nice day!"" and ""What a wonderful world"" are indicative of non-toxicity.
    *   **Hate Speech/Aggression:** Directly insulting someone or expressing strong negative opinions towards them usually means toxicity.

**Predicted Label for the Last Example:**

Based on the pattern, ""I advise the Feds to follow the money that is given to these anti American religious sovereign terrorists.""  I would classify this as **toxic (1)**.  Although it doesn't use explicit swear words, it:

*   Accuses a group of people (religious sovereign terrorists) of being anti-American.
*   Contains accusatory language and potentially promotes hatred or distrust towards that group.

**Therefore, my classification for the last example is:**

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed for classifying text toxicity, following your specifications:

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier specializing in identifying toxic language. You will be provided with a sentence and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic content. Toxicity is defined as rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion. Examples of toxic language include threats, insults, identity-based hate speech, profanity and sexually explicit language.

First, carefully read the sentence and identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiment.
Second, based on your analysis, determine whether the sentence as a whole should be considered toxic.
Third, provide your final answer by strictly adhering to the required format.

The label is **toxicity**, which is a **binary** classification (0 or 1). A value of 1 indicates the presence of toxicity, and 0 indicates its absence.

The text is in **English**, and you should provide your reasoning in English as well.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a friendly message.""
Reasoning: The sentence expresses a friendly sentiment and does not contain any rude, disrespectful, or hateful language.
Answer: toxicity: [0]

*   **Definition of Toxicity:** Text is considered toxic if it contains insults, threats, hate speech, or any language intended to demean, marginalize, or incite violence against individuals or groups based on attributes like race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc. Also, consider severely negative statements or accusations as toxic.
*   **Language:** The language of the text provided will be English.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** The prompt guides the model to first identify potentially offensive or harmful elements within the text, then consider the intent and impact of those elements, and finally make a binary classification (0 or 1) based on whether the text meets the definition of toxicity.
*   **Output Format:** The output must strictly adhere to the format `toxicity: []`, with the appropriate binary classification (0 or 1) placed within the square brackets.

Your task is to analyze the provided text and determine whether it contains any elements of toxicity, such as insults, threats, hate speech, or language intended to demean or marginalize individuals or groups. Consider the intent and potential impact of the text.

Here's how to approach the task:

1.  Carefully read the text.
2.  Identify any potentially offensive, aggressive, or harmful statements.
3.  Evaluate whether the identified statements are directed at individuals or groups and whether they promote hatred, discrimination, or violence.
4.  Based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

Remember, a text is toxic if it contains insults, threats, hate speech, or any language intended to demean, marginalize, or incite violence against individuals or groups based on attributes like race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc. Also, consider severely negative statements or accusations as toxic.

Now, analyze the following text:

'Dear world:
Just a reminder that none of these folks actually live in Oregon.  Please remember that when you decide to paint our state as a bunch of wackos!

Does this text contain toxicity? Explain your reasoning step by step.

First, I read the provided text and identify potentially offensive statements. The phrase ""a bunch of wackos"" could be considered pejorative.

Second, I evaluate whether the identified statement promotes hatred, discrimination, or violence. The phrase ""a bunch of wackos"" is indeed a slur that aims to damage the image of the state.

Third, based on my analysis, I classify the text. It does include toxicity.

   - The text is addressed to ""Dear world"" and is framed as a reminder.
   - It mentions ""none of these folks actually live in Oregon"" and asks the reader to remember this when ""you decide to paint our state as a bunch of wackos.""
   - The term ""wackos"" is somewhat derogatory, but it's used in reference to how others might portray Oregon, not as a direct insult to a specific individual or group.
   - The tone is defensive but not overtly hostile or harmful.
   - The intent seems to be correcting a perceived misrepresentation rather than attacking or demeaning others.

3. **Potential Offensiveness**:
   - The word ""wackos"" could be seen as mildly offensive, but it's not a severe slur or insult.
   - The overall message is not hostile or harmful, just assertive.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - While there is a mildly derogatory term (""wackos""), the text lacks clear toxicity (e.g., direct insults, threats, or demeaning language aimed at a person/group).
   - A reasonable person might not find this text highly offensive or harmful.

**Final Classification**: toxicity: 0"|"<prompt>

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to break down the text and identify any potentially toxic elements.

First, let's define what we mean by toxicity:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. Includes threats, insults, obscenity, identity hate, etc.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 otherwise')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, consider the following text:

'Dear world:
Just a reminder that none of these folks actually live in Oregon. Please remember that when you decide to paint our state as a bunch of wackos!

Sincerely,

Let's break down the text. Does the text contain:

1.  Explicit insults or name-calling?
2.  Threats or aggressive language?
3.  Hate speech or targeting of specific groups?
4.  Obscenity or offensive language?
5.  Disrespectful or rude statements?

Based on your analysis of these questions and the definition of toxicity, does the text contain toxicity? Answer only with: 'toxicity: []', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.

<prompt>
You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to determine whether a given text contains toxic content. Toxic content is defined as text that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. You will output ""toxicity: [1]"" if the text contains toxic content, and ""toxicity: [0]"" if the text does not contain toxic content.

The text is in English and consists of simple sentences, forming a short message.

Here's how you should approach the problem:

1.  **Read the text carefully.** Understand the overall meaning and intent.
2.  **Identify potentially toxic elements:** Look for rudeness, disrespect, insults, threats, or language that could be offensive or dismissive. Consider the context of the message. Does the text attack a person or group? Does it promote hatred or violence?
3.  **Make a judgment:** Based on your analysis, decide whether the text is toxic according to the definition.
4.  **Output the classification:** Provide your final answer in the format ""toxicity: [ ]"", replacing the square brackets with either ""1"" (toxic) or ""0"" (not toxic).

Here's an example:

Text: 'Dear world:
Just a reminder that none of these folks actually live in Oregon. Please remember that when you decide to paint our state as a bunch of wackos!

Sincerely,
Oregon'.

First, I read the text and determine the intent of the message.
Second, I look for potentially toxic element like rude words, disrespect, insults, threats, or language that could be offensive or dismissive. In this case the word 'wackos' could be considered a rude word.
Third, I judge if the text is toxic according to the definition.

"|"Here's a step-by-step analysis of the text ""They are terrorists pure and simple"" to determine its toxicity:

1. **Hateful/Disrespectful/Offensive:** The label ""terrorists"" is a highly charged and negative term. Labeling a group as such is inherently offensive and disrespectful, as it implies extreme violence and disregard for human life. The addition of ""pure and simple"" amplifies the negativity and leaves no room for nuance or alternative interpretations.

2. **Aggressive:** The statement carries an aggressive tone, particularly if directed towards a specific group of people. It is accusatory and does not invite discussion or understanding.

3. **Demeaning/Discriminatory:** The term ""terrorists"" is used to demonize and dehumanize the individuals or group being referred to, effectively promoting discrimination and prejudice.

4. **Derogatory Labels:** The statement uses the derogatory label ""terrorists.""

5. **Harmful Generalizations:** The statement generalizes and ascribes a highly negative characteristic (""terrorists"") to an entire group, without acknowledging individual differences or circumstances.

6. **Targeting a Specific Group/Suggesting Violence/Hatred:** While the statement doesn't explicitly suggest violence, the label ""terrorists"" is strongly associated with violence, inciting fear and potentially justifying hostile actions. It promotes hatred by portraying the targeted group as inherently evil.

Based on this analysis, the text is toxic.

The statement labels a group of people as ""terrorists."" This is a highly charged term that carries significant negative connotations and implies danger and violence. Labelling a group of people as terrorists may be considered disparaging and potentially promoting negative sentiment towards that group.

Therefore, based on this analysis, we can classify the text as toxic.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language. You will receive a text passage and must determine if it contains toxic content. Toxicity is defined as any language that is rude, disrespectful, dehumanizing, uses hate speech, or threatens violence.

First, carefully read the text passage and identify any words, phrases, or sentiments that could be considered toxic. Explain your reasoning step-by-step. Then, based on your analysis, classify the text as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

The response must follow this format:
""Reasoning: [Your step-by-step reasoning about why the text is toxic or not]
Toxicity: [0 or 1]""

Here is the text:

Text: ""They are terrorists pure and simple.""
<\prompt>
"||"Reasoning: The text uses the label ""terrorists"" to describe a group of people. While ""terrorist"" can be a factual descriptor in certain contexts, it carries a heavy negative connotation and often dehumanizes the individuals being labeled. In this context, without further information, it appears to be used as a derogatory term.

"|0.0|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task you've described:

**Explanation of Labels:**

*   **Toxicity (1):** The text contains language that is offensive, hateful, or intended to demean, insult, threaten, or discriminate against individuals or groups based on factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics. It also encompasses language that promotes violence or incites hatred.
*   **Non-Toxic (0):** The text does not contain any offensive, hateful, or discriminatory language. It is respectful, neutral, or positive in tone.

**Language of the Text:** English

<prompt>

You are an expert text classifier specializing in identifying toxicity in online text. You will be given a text and your task is to classify whether the text contains toxicity or not. Pay close attention to the context of the text and potential subtle forms of toxicity, such as derogatory terms or implicit biases.

Here's how you should approach the task:

1.  **Read the text carefully and identify the language of the text.**
2.  **Identify potential toxic elements:** Carefully examine the text for any words, phrases, or sentiments that could be interpreted as offensive, hateful, discriminatory, or threatening. Consider the target audience and the potential impact of the language used.
3.  **Determine the overall sentiment:** Assess the overall tone and sentiment of the text. Is it generally positive, negative, or neutral? Does the text promote or condone harmful behavior or attitudes?
4.  **Synthesize your analysis:** Based on your analysis of potential toxic elements and the overall sentiment, make a final determination of whether the text contains toxicity.
5.  **Provide your classification:** Output ""toxicity: \[0 or 1]"" to give the classification, do not give any other text. If you have identified toxic elements and the overall sentiment is negative or harmful, classify the text as toxic (1). Otherwise, classify it as non-toxic (0).

Here is an example:

Text: ""This is a positive and respectful message.""

The language of the text is english. The message does not have toxic elements, and the overall sentiment is positive. Therefore, this is a non-toxic message.

toxicity: \[0]

Here is the text you need to classify:

Text: 'Love it! Alas, though, there are no fun non-derogatory nouns for the male equivalent of tomboy. My son's choices will be relegated to ""sissy""/""mama's boy"" or ""variant""/""nonconforming"". Yes, he's a ""boy"" and ""human"" -- but as you noted, the power of self-identification as something cool and different can be magical.'.

Now, perform the classification. Remember to output ""toxicity: \[0 or 1]"".
<\prompt>
"|"The language of the text is English. The text discusses the lack of positive non-derogatory terms for boys who exhibit traits considered traditionally feminine, contrasting it with the term ""tomboy"" for girls. While the text mentions potentially derogatory terms (""sissy,"" ""mama's boy""), it does so in a critical manner, highlighting the lack of positive alternatives. The overall sentiment is one of concern and a desire for more inclusive language. The text does not promote hatred or discrimination.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step approach to break down the text and identify any potentially harmful elements.

First, consider the following definitions:
- ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel unwelcome or threatened.')
- ('Non-toxic', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and inclusive.')

Now, consider the label types:
- ('Label type', 'Binary classification')
- ('Binary Values', '0 = Non-toxic, 1 = Toxic')

The text to analyze is: 'Love it! Alas, though, there are no fun non-derogatory nouns for the male equivalent of tomboy. My son's choices will be relegated to ""sissy""/""mama's boy"" or ""variant""/""nonconforming"". Yes, he's a ""boy"" and ""human"" -- but as you noted, the power of self-identification as something cool and different can be magical.'.

Let's break it down:
1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** Examine the text for words or phrases that could be considered offensive, insulting, or discriminatory. Look for stereotypes, slurs, or language that demeans individuals or groups.
2.  **Assess the context:** Determine the intent behind the potentially offensive words. Is the language used in a harmful or malicious way? Or is it part of a broader discussion or criticism that is not intended to be toxic?
3.  **Determine the target:** Decide if the offensive language is directed at a specific individual or group. Toxic language is more likely when targeted.
4.  **Overall assessment:** Based on the identification of offensive language, the context, and the target, provide a final assessment on whether the text is toxic or not.

('Language', 'English')

Based on the step-by-step analysis above, classify the text as toxic or non-toxic by providing the classification label (0 or 1) within the brackets in the following format:

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"Here's an analysis of the text and the toxicity classification:

1. **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** The phrases ""sissy"" and ""mama's boy"" are potentially offensive as they can be used to demean boys who don't conform to traditional masculine stereotypes. While ""variant""/""nonconforming"" are not inherently offensive, the context suggests they are being presented as less desirable options.

2. **Assess the context:** The author is lamenting the lack of positive, non-derogatory terms for boys who don't fit traditional gender roles, contrasting it with the positive connotation of ""tomboy."" The intent is to criticize societal limitations, not to directly attack or demean anyone. The use of ""sissy""/""mama's boy"" is presented as examples of the *negative* labels available, not as labels the author is applying or endorsing.

3. **Determine the target:** The text isn't directly targeting any specific individual or group with the potentially offensive terms. The target is more abstract: societal expectations and the lack of positive language.

4. **Overall assessment:** While the text uses potentially offensive words (""sissy,"" ""mama's boy""), it does so in a critical context to highlight the problem of limited and often negative labels for boys who don't conform to traditional gender roles. The intent is not to be toxic, rude, disrespectful or threatening. Therefore, it's more appropriately classified as non-toxic.

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a chain-of-thought prompt designed for the toxicity classification task, incorporating the specified instructions:

**Explanation of the Label:**

*   **Label:** `toxicity`
*   **Definition:** This label indicates whether the given text contains toxic language, defined as rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion.
*   **Type:** Binary Classification (0 or 1)
    *   `1`: The text contains toxicity.
    *   `0`: The text does not contain toxicity.
*   **Language:** English
*   **Format:** Simple sentences.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxicity in text. You will be provided with a text passage and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic language. Toxic language is defined as rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion.

Here's how you should approach this task:

1.  **Read the text carefully.** Pay close attention to the words used, the tone, and the overall message.
2.  **Identify potentially toxic elements.** Look for insults, threats, hate speech, or any language that could be considered offensive or disrespectful.
3.  **Consider the context.** Sometimes, words that might seem toxic on their own are not toxic when used in a specific context.
4.  **Determine if the text, on the whole, is toxic.** If it contains toxic elements that are not offset by other factors, then it is toxic.
5.  **Provide your answer in the format `toxicity: [ ]`.** Fill in the square brackets with either `1` if the text is toxic or `0` if the text is not toxic.

Here's an example:

Text: ""I think you're completely wrong, and your idea is stupid.""
This text contains disrespectful language (""stupid""). Therefore, it is toxic.
Answer: toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: ""Love it! Alas, though, there are no fun non-derogatory nouns for the male equivalent of tomboy. My son's choices will be relegated to ""sissy""/""mama's boy"" or ""variant""/""nonconforming"". Yes, he's a ""boy"" and ""human"" -- but as you noted, the power of self-identification as something cool and different can be magical.""

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic content. We will use a step-by-step approach to ensure accuracy.

First, let's define what constitutes toxic content in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, consider the text: 'ur a sh*tty comment.'

Step 1: Identify potentially offensive words or phrases. In this case, ""sh*tty"" is a vulgar term.

Step 2: Evaluate the context in which the word is used. The phrase ""ur a sh*tty comment"" directly insults the quality of a comment.

Step 3: Determine if the language is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel insulted. Given the use of a vulgar term and the direct insult, it is likely to cause offense.

Step 4: Based on the above analysis, determine if the text contains toxicity. If the text contains any toxic content, the answer is 1. Otherwise, it is 0.

You are an expert in identifying toxic language in text. Your task is to analyze the given text and determine if it contains any language that is offensive, abusive, hateful, or otherwise harmful. You must provide your reasoning step-by-step, before giving the final answer.

First, carefully read the provided text. Then, consider the following questions:

1.  Does the text contain any words or phrases that are commonly considered offensive or vulgar?
2.  Does the text express hostility or aggression towards any individual or group?
3.  Does the text promote violence, discrimination, or hatred?
4.  Does the text use insults, name-calling, or personal attacks?

Based on your answers to these questions, determine whether the text should be classified as toxic or non-toxic.

Finally, provide your answer in the format: `toxicity: []`, replacing the square brackets with either `1` (if toxic) or `0` (if non-toxic).

Here's an example:

**Text:** ""This is a harmless and polite message.""

**Reasoning:** The text does not contain any offensive words, express hostility, promote violence, or use insults. Therefore, it is non-toxic.

**Answer:** toxicity: [0]

Now, analyze the following text:

**Text:** ""ur a sh*tty comment.""
<\prompt>
"|1.0|"**Reasoning:**

1. The text contains the phrase ""sh*tty,"" which is a censored version of a vulgar word.
2. The text contains a personal attack directed at ""ur,"" implying the comment made by that user is of low quality.
3. The word ""sh*tty"" is generally considered offensive.

Therefore, the text is toxic.

Text: 'I don't believe it for one minute!! Neither should you! The Propaganda is neck deep on this one!'

First, analyze the text for explicit insults or threats. Are there any direct attacks on individuals or groups?
Second, consider the tone and language used. Is the language disrespectful or dismissive? Does it promote negativity or hostility?
Third, evaluate the overall impact of the message. Could the content reasonably be interpreted as offensive or likely to provoke a negative reaction from others?

Based on your analysis, does the text contain elements of toxicity? Answer '1' if it contains toxicity and '0' otherwise.

First, carefully read the following text: 'I don't believe it for one minute!! Neither should you! The Propaganda is neck deep on this one!'.

Now, consider the definition of toxicity. Toxicity in text refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome.

Analyze the text for elements like:
1.  Insults or name-calling: Are any individuals or groups directly attacked or labelled with derogatory terms?
2.  Threats: Does the text contain any explicit or implied threats of violence or harm?
3.  Hate speech: Does the text promote hatred or discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other characteristics?
4.  Disrespectful language: Does the text use rude, offensive, or dismissive language towards individuals or groups?
5. Inflammatory language: Is the text designed to provoke anger or strong negative emotions?

In this specific case, does the text contain any of the elements outlined above? The phrase ""The Propaganda is neck deep on this one!"" expresses strong disagreement and accuses something of being propaganda. While accusatory, it does not directly target individuals with insults or threats, nor does it promote hate speech. The tone is dismissive, but not overtly toxic.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach, considering factors like offensive language, personal attacks, and the intent to harm or degrade.

Here's the text: 'I don't believe it for one minute!! Neither should you! The Propaganda is neck deep on this one!'

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome. It includes hate speech, aggressive statements, and content that attacks or demeans individuals or groups.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary: 1 if the text contains toxicity, 0 if it does not.')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's break down the text:

1.  **Identify potential offensive words or phrases:** In this text, ""Propaganda is neck deep"" might be seen as inflammatory, but it depends on the context. There aren't any explicit slurs or personal insults.

2.  **Assess the intent:** Is the writer trying to attack someone or a group? The text seems to target an idea or a narrative (""Propaganda"") rather than a person. The phrases indicate strong disagreement and urging others to share that disagreement.

3.  **Evaluate the overall tone:** While emphatic, the tone is more argumentative than outright abusive. It expresses strong dissent but doesn't directly target anyone with hateful or demeaning language.

4.  **Final Decision:** Based on the analysis above, does the text meet the definition of toxicity we established?

Therefore, the classification is:

toxicity: []
</prompt>
"|0.0|"toxicity: [0]
"|"Okay, I will create a few-shot prompt for classifying text toxicity.

<prompt>
Here are some examples of text and their toxicity labels:

Text: 'This is a great movie! I really enjoyed it.'
toxicity: [0]

Text: 'You are so stupid and annoying. I hate you!'
toxicity: [1]

Text: 'The weather is quite pleasant today.'
toxicity: [0]

Text: 'What a terrible idea. You should be ashamed of yourself.'
toxicity: [1]

Text: 'I don't believe it for one minute!! Neither should you! The Propaganda is neck deep on this one!'
toxicity: []

('Label definition', '1 if the text contains toxic language, 0 if it does not.')
('Label type', 'Binary')
('Language', 'English')
</prompt>
"||"Okay, I understand.  Based on the provided examples and definitions, I can infer the following about toxicity labeling:

*   **Toxicity is determined by the presence of insults, hate speech, or generally abusive language.** This includes direct personal attacks (e.g., ""You are so stupid""), shaming language (e.g., ""You should be ashamed""), and expressing hatred (e.g., ""I hate you"").
*   **Neutral or positive statements are labeled as non-toxic.**  Statements about the weather or expressing enjoyment are considered non-toxic.
*   **Strong opinions or disagreements alone do not necessarily indicate toxicity.** For example, ""What a terrible idea"" is borderline and needs the accompanying ""You should be ashamed"" to push it into the toxic category.

Regarding the example with an empty toxicity label:

*   **'I don't believe it for one minute!! Neither should you! The Propaganda is neck deep on this one!'** The label is empty. This might indicate uncertainty, ambiguity, or that the provided model is not very well calibrated. The text expresses strong disagreement and accuses something of being ""Propaganda,"" which could potentially be considered toxic depending on context and intent.  However, without direct insults or hate speech, it might be considered borderline.

My current understanding is that the absence of toxicity labels should be addressed. It would make more sense to either:
1.  Label it as 1 or 0
2.  Give a probability score of how toxic the text is.

I am ready to apply this understanding to new text examples and provide toxicity labels (0 or 1) based on the guidelines. Just provide the text.

"|1.0|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity, adhering to your specific instructions.

**Explanation of the Label:**

*   `toxicity: [ ]` - This label indicates whether the given text contains toxic language or not. A value of `1` signifies the presence of toxicity, while `0` indicates its absence. Toxicity can include profanity, insults, threats, hate speech, or any language intended to offend, demean, or harm.

**Language of the Text:** The language of the text is English.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxic language. Remember, toxicity includes profanity, insults, threats, hate speech, or any language intended to offend, demean, or harm.

**Text:** 'Sorry to have to do this, but just to see if profanity filtering is enabled: fuck.'

First, consider the presence of profanity. Does the text contain words that are generally considered offensive or vulgar?

Second, analyze the intent behind the language. Is the language used to insult, threaten, or demean anyone? Is it used to promote hatred or discrimination?

Third, based on the analysis of profanity and intent, determine if the text contains toxic language.

Given the text provided, does it contain toxicity? Answer with 'toxicity: [ ]', in the square parents put 1 if contain toxicity, 0 otherwhise.
<\prompt>
"|"First, the text contains the word ""fuck,"" which is widely considered profanity.

Second, the stated intent is to test a profanity filter. While the word itself is offensive, the context suggests it's not being used to insult, threaten, demean, or promote hatred. It's being used for a technical test. However, the use of profanity, regardless of intent, can be considered toxic depending on the context and audience.

Third, considering the presence of profanity, even if used for testing, the text can be considered to contain toxic language.

"|"Okay, I understand. You've provided examples of text snippets labeled with a toxicity score (either 0 for non-toxic or 1 for toxic). The last example, containing profanity, has an empty toxicity score. This suggests you're aiming to train or evaluate a system that can detect toxicity in text, and you want my help to understand or expand on this dataset.

**Based on the data you've provided, here are a few observations and possible directions:**

*   **Clear distinction:** The examples clearly differentiate between positive/neutral language and explicitly negative/offensive language.
*   **Basic toxicity detection:** The system seems to be catching some basic forms of toxicity, like insults and expressions of hate.
*   **Profanity handling:** The empty toxicity score for the profanity example could indicate:
    *   The system isn't trained on explicit profanity.
    *   The system requires a higher confidence threshold to flag profanity as toxic.
    *   The system is designed to specifically flag profanity *separately* from general toxicity, perhaps for moderation purposes.
    *   It may be to see if there is a profanity filter in place.
*   **Limited scope:** The examples are quite short and straightforward. Real-world toxic language can be much more subtle, nuanced, and context-dependent.

**Here's how I can potentially assist you:**

1.  **Expanding the dataset:** I can generate more examples of both toxic and non-toxic text, covering a wider range of expressions, including:
    *   Subtle forms of aggression (e.g., passive-aggressive comments)
    *   Sarcasm
    *   Threats
    *   Hate speech targeting specific groups
    *   Variations in politeness and tone
    *   Context-dependent toxicity (e.g., a statement that is harmless in one context but offensive in another)
    *   Profanity of varying degrees of severity.

2.  **Refining the toxicity scores:** We can discuss the nuances of toxicity and refine the scoring system. For example:
    *   Would you like a more granular scale than 0 and 1 (e.g., a scale from 0 to 5)?
    *   Should the severity of the profanity influence the score?
    *   How do you want to handle potentially offensive language used in a constructive or educational way?

3.  **Analyzing the system's performance:** If you provide more data and the system's output, I can help analyze its strengths and weaknesses in detecting toxicity.

4.  **Brainstorming edge cases:** We can brainstorm situations where toxicity detection is particularly challenging.

**To help me tailor my response, please tell me:**

*   What is the *goal* of this project? Are you building a toxicity filter, training a model, or evaluating an existing system?
*   What type of text are you primarily concerned with (e.g., social media comments, forum posts, customer reviews)?
*   What is the target audience or user base? (e.g., general public, specific online community)
*   Are there any specific types of toxicity that are particularly important to detect (e.g., hate speech, harassment, threats)?
*   What should the system do when it detects toxicity (e.g., flag the comment for review, automatically remove the comment, warn the user)?
*   Do you have any specific requests for the type of toxic/non-toxic examples I should generate?
*   Do you need examples in any specific style or tone?

- **0 (Non-toxic):** The text does not contain any offensive or harmful language.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a binary classification approach. Consider elements such as profanity, insults, threats, hate speech, and aggressive language to determine the presence of toxicity.

Here's the breakdown of the labels:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Presence of harmful, offensive, or negative language intended to cause harm or offense.')
*   ('Non-Toxicity', 'Absence of harmful, offensive, or negative language.')

The label type is:

*   ('Binary', 'The classification task involves choosing between two mutually exclusive categories: Toxicity or Non-Toxicity')

The language of the text is:

*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, let's think step by step.

Text: 'Sorry to have to do this, but just to see if profanity filtering is enabled: fuck.'

First, identify any potentially toxic words or phrases. In this case, the word ""fuck"" is considered profanity.

Second, determine if the presence of this word makes the entire text toxic. Since the statement aims to test the filtering, it still uses profanity and thus indicates toxicity.

Third, based on the analysis, provide the final classification.

Therefore, the text contains toxicity.

Answer only with: toxicity: []. Fill the square bracket with the right label.

You are an expert text classifier. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity includes profanity, insults, threats, or hate speech. You must output your classification in a specific format.

First, carefully read the text and identify any instances of toxic language. Explain your reasoning step by step. After your reasoning, provide your final classification in the format ""toxicity: [ ]"", where the square brackets contain either ""1"" if the text is toxic or ""0"" if the text is not toxic.

Here's an example:

**Text:** ""I think you're awesome!""
Reasoning: The text expresses a positive sentiment and contains no profanity, insults, threats, or hate speech. Therefore, it is not toxic.
toxicity: [0]

Here's another example:

**Text:** ""This is complete bullshit!""
Reasoning: The text contains the profanity ""bullshit."" Therefore, it is toxic.
toxicity: [1]

Let's analyze the following text to determine if it contains toxicity. Toxicity, in this context, refers to language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome. It can include insults, name-calling, pejorative generalizations, or any statement that diminishes or attacks a person or group of people.

The text is: 'The Troll is strong with this one.'

First, consider whether the text contains any insults or name-calling.  'Troll' is often used as a pejorative term online to describe someone who intentionally provokes or harasses others. Calling someone a 'Troll' implies negative intent.

Second, consider the impact this phrase might have on the person being addressed. Is it likely to make them feel attacked, insulted, or unwelcome? Given the negative connotations of 'Troll', it is likely the recipient would perceive the statement negatively.

Third, based on the above analysis, does the text contain toxicity? Answer with 'toxicity: [1]' if you think it does, otherwise 'toxicity: [0]'.

If the text contains insults, hate speech, threats, or disrespect, explain the target and nature of the toxicity. If the text is not toxic, explain why it is neutral or harmless.
 Finally, based on your analysis, provide a classification using the requested format.

 Here's the text:

It's why the local papers criticized the lies to sell the CRC freeway then endorsed Metro President Hughes who fast-tracked it.

The only glimmer of hope is unions with member controlled endorsements will always endorse Sanders over Clinton.

 Now, think step by step, and provide your final answer using the following format:

 toxicity: []
 <\prompt>
"|"Here's my analysis of the provided text:

The text expresses strong criticism of political decisions and actors. It alleges corruption and undue influence of money in politics. While the language is accusatory and negative, it doesn't directly target individuals with insults, hate speech, or threats. The text criticizes groups like ""democrats who control Salem Oregon"" and ""corrupt union leaderships,"" but this is done in the context of expressing political disagreement rather than personal attacks. The term ""corrupt"" is a strong accusation, but is directed at institutions rather than individuals. While the sentiment is negative, the text primarily conveys political criticism.

"|"Okay, I understand. Here's a Chain-of-Thought prompt designed to classify text for toxicity:

<prompt>
First, carefully read the provided text and identify any language that could be considered offensive, hateful, biased, or disrespectful. Consider the target of the language. Does it attack individuals, groups, or institutions in a way that promotes negativity or harm? Does it use stereotypes, slurs, or pejoratives? Next, evaluate the overall tone and intent of the message. Is it meant to incite anger, division, or violence? Is it critical in a constructive way, or is it purely destructive? Finally, considering all of these factors, make a determination as to whether the text contains toxicity. If the text contains language or sentiments that are offensive, hateful, biased, disrespectful, or intended to incite negativity or harm, classify it as toxic. Otherwise, classify it as non-toxic.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a step-by-step approach to determine if the text contains toxic elements.

First, let's define what we mean by toxicity. Toxicity includes language that is hateful, disrespectful, offensive, abusive, threatening, or discriminatory. It can also include personal attacks, insults, or language that is intended to demean or harm an individual or group.

Now, let's break down the text into smaller parts and analyze each part for the presence of toxic elements. Consider the following aspects:

1.  **Hate Speech:** Does the text contain any expressions of hatred or prejudice towards individuals or groups based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other protected characteristics?

2.  **Personal Attacks:** Does the text contain direct insults, name-calling, or other forms of personal attacks directed at specific individuals or groups?

3.  **Offensive Language:** Does the text contain swear words, slurs, or other language that is generally considered offensive or inappropriate?

4.  **Threats:** Does the text contain any explicit or implied threats of violence or harm towards individuals or groups?

5.  **Disrespectful Language:** Does the text use language that is intended to demean or belittle individuals or groups?

Based on this analysis determine if the text contains toxicity.

Here's the text: 'Another 80 million for a corporation with billions in revenue. Money can buy lawmakers so easily. It's why the local papers criticized the lies to sell the CRC freeway then endorsed Metro President Hughes who fast-tracked it.

The only glimmer of hope is unions with member controlled endorsements will always endorse Sanders over Clinton. Until we get a revolution we have corporate control of our gov budgets http://electjoerowe.com/stimulus'

Now, consider the following label definitions, label type, and language:

*   ('Label definition', '1: The text contains toxicity as defined above; 0: The text does not contain toxicity as defined above.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary classification')
*   ('Language', 'English')

**Format:** Simple sentences within a paragraph.

**Explanation of the Label:** The label ""toxicity"" indicates the presence of harmful, offensive, or malicious language in the text. This can include insults, threats, hate speech, or any language intended to demean or harm individuals or groups.

**Definition of Label Type:** The label is binary, meaning it can only have one of two values:

*   1: The text contains toxicity.
*   0: The text does not contain toxicity.

**Language of the Text:** English

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language. You will be provided with a text passage and your task is to determine whether it contains toxic content. Consider elements such as insults, threats, hate speech, profanity, or any language intended to demean or harm individuals or groups.

First, carefully read the passage and identify any potentially toxic phrases or statements. Explain your reasoning for considering those phrases as toxic. Then, based on your analysis, determine whether the passage as a whole contains toxicity. Finally, output your decision in the format ""toxicity: [ ]"", inserting either '1' (if toxic) or '0' (if not toxic) inside the brackets.

Here's an example:

Text: ""This is a friendly message. Have a nice day!""
The text does not contain insults, hate speech, or threats.

<prompt>
Let's analyze the following text for toxicity. We will use a step-by-step reasoning approach to determine if the text contains toxic language.

First, let's define what constitutes toxicity in this context:

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome.')
*   ('Label type', 'Binary (0 or 1)')
*   ('Language', 'English')

Now, consider the following text:

Text: 'You're an idiot.'

Let's break down the analysis:

1.  **Identify potentially offensive words or phrases:** The phrase ""idiot"" is commonly used as an insult and is considered offensive.

2.  **Assess the intent and context:** In this direct statement, the intent is clearly to insult the recipient. There is no mitigating context to lessen the impact of the word.

3.  **Determine if the language meets the definition of toxicity:** Based on the definition above, the use of the word ""idiot"" to directly insult someone qualifies as toxic language.

4.  **Assign the appropriate label:** Since the text contains toxic language, we assign the label '1'.

Therefore, the classification is:

toxicity: []

Let's think step by step. First, carefully read the given text and identify any words, phrases, or sentiments that could be considered offensive, aggressive, disrespectful, or harmful. Consider whether the text promotes violence, hatred, or discrimination towards any individual or group. Also, consider the context of the text, if available.

Based on your analysis, determine if the text contains any form of toxicity. If the text includes toxic elements, assign a value of 1. If the text is free from toxicity, assign a value of 0.

The text is: 'So sorry for our lose

**Definitions:**

*   ('Toxicity', 'Language that is rude, disrespectful, or likely to make someone leave a discussion. It includes hate speech, threats, insults, and abusive language.')
*   ('Non-Toxicity', 'Language that is polite, respectful, and contributes positively to a discussion.')

**Label Definitions:**

*   ('1', 'The text contains toxic content as defined above.')
*   ('0', 'The text does not contain toxic content.')

**Label Type:**

*   ('Binary Classification', 'Each text is classified into one of two categories: toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).')

**Language:**

*   ('Language', 'English')

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Read the text carefully.**
2.  **Identify any potentially toxic words, phrases, or sentiments.** Consider if the language is offensive, disrespectful, or intended to harm.
3.  **Evaluate the overall context.** A word or phrase might be considered toxic in one context but not in another.
4.  **Determine if the text's primary intent or likely impact is to be toxic.**
5.  **Assign a label (0 or 1) based on your evaluation.**

**Example:**

Text: ""You are a stupid idiot and I hate you.""

*   Step 1: Read the text.
*   Step 2: ""stupid idiot"", ""hate you"" are potentially toxic phrases.
*   Step 3: The overall context appears to be a direct insult.

**Language of the text:** Primarily English, although slang, abbreviations, and misspellings are possible.

<prompt>
You are an expert in identifying toxic language in social media posts. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine whether it contains toxic content. Toxicity includes rude, disrespectful, or offensive language that could cause someone to feel threatened, insulted, or unwelcome.

Here's how you should approach the task:

1.  Carefully read the input text.
2.  Consider whether the text contains any words, phrases, or sentiments that could be considered offensive, disrespectful, or threatening.
3.  Evaluate the overall tone and intent of the message. Is it intended to harm or demean?
4.  Based on your analysis, determine whether the text is toxic or not.
5.  Output your answer in the format: `toxicity: [ ]`.  Place a `1` inside the brackets if the text contains toxicity. Place a `0` inside the brackets if the text does not contain toxicity.

Here are some examples:

**Example 1:**

Text: ""You're an idiot and your ideas are terrible.""
Reasoning: The text contains direct insults (""idiot"") and disparaging remarks (""your ideas are terrible""). This is clearly toxic.
Output: toxicity: [1]

**Example 2:**

Text: ""I disagree with your opinion, but I respect your right to have it.""
Reasoning: The text expresses disagreement but does so in a respectful manner. There is no toxic language present.
Output: toxicity: [0]

**Example 3:**

Text: ""This is so frustrating! I can't believe this happened.""
Reasoning: The text expresses frustration, but it is not directed at anyone and does not contain any offensive language.
Output: toxicity: [0]

**Example 4:**

Text: ""Shut up you dumbass.""
Reasoning: The text contains offensive insults and abusive language.
Output: toxicity: [1]

Now, analyze the following text:

Text: ""So sorry for our lose
#feelthebern""
